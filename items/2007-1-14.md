<h3>Noticias de una guerra</h3>
<p>
	February, 1936. Difficult years for almost everyone. Some scenes remembered me to Life is Beautiful, when children were sepparated from their families 
and sent to a better place to live, but I must recognize was feeling lost during some pieces, as I didn't remember exactly what happened during those 
years. I should have read before a couple of articles to refresh my memory, so if you're on the same situation, maybe these entries can help you to 
understand history a little bit more: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_%28Spain%29">Popular Front (Spain)</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War">Spanish Civil War</a>.

	Every frame's in black and white, and [very well] mixed up between original recordings and some more new, where there was no media to reconstruct happenings. There are really hard-scenes, with burned people, children crying, etc., but most impresive for me was the face of a man, who was sat down behind us, alone, and didn't move during some seconds after the film finished, with a lost look, like trying to assimilate every situation he watched, because it's likely someone closer lost something there...

	I forgot it, you can watch the <a href="http://sansebastian.mister-i.com/galerias2006/trailer_es.jsp?id=540156">trailer</a> (Spanish). However, I really encourage you to watch the film.
