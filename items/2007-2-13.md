<h3>Exams are out</h3>
<p>
	Yeah! I've finished my exams for now and am very happy with results. Marks have increased since I decided to concentrate on studying and that's something good.
</p>
<p>
	As time goes by, this morning I've started to prepare some material for two important incoming events: our classes on <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">Mono</a> at <a href="http://www.master.grupolouise.com/default.aspx">M&aacute;ster en Tecnolog&iacute;as Web</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.us.es/DiNeT/">DiNeT</a>'s conference at <a href="http://imaginatica.eii.us.es/2007/">Imagin&aacute;tica 2007</a>. I've been waiting during some months for them and am excited with its arrival. I'll try to do my best on both.
