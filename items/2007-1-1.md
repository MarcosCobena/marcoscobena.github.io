<h3>Happy New Year...</h3>
<p>
	... for those who, unfortunately, don't know what that word means.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Proposals for 2007</h3>
<p>
	Things I'd like to carry out during this, for now young, new year:
	
	<ul>
		<li>To keep on helping for a better world (yes, I'm absolutely sure we can change it).</li>
		<li>To take things easier.</li>
		<li>To almost finish my studies.</li>
		<li>To be able to develop a consistent framework related to cortical activity (more to come).</li>
		<li>To contribute coding/fixing some bits into <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">Mono</a> (I currently do, but in some <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Contributing">other ways</a>).</li>
		<li>To take practical lessons for playing the piano.</li>
		<li>To travel to London.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	I'm sure will add some more during the week.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Update</strong>: a new one: to make people laugh (to achieve this, I'll need to learn new [good] jokes :-) ).
