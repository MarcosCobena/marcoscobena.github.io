<h3>Mind Wide Open : Your Brain and the Neuroscience of Everyday Life</h3>
<p>
	I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743241665/stevenberlinj-20">this book</a> yesterday night. Simply <a href="http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/">clever</a>.
</p>
<p>
	My <a href="http://www.joseantoniocobena.com/">father</a>, this morning, swaped this one by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684868768/stevenberlinj-20">Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software</a> with me. First chapter read.

<h3>Rosso relativo</h3>
<p>
	I've just bought, through <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a>, this album from <a href="http://www.tizianoferro.com/">Tiziano Ferro</a>. It's amazing: just 1 click (yes, *one*; well, 2 maybe), 5 minutes of download, italian version, not spanish one. :-)
