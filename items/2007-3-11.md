<h3>"Turbocharging Linux With Mono"</h3>
<p>
	I'm watching right now Miguel de Icaza's <a href="http://ftp.belnet.be/mirrors/FOSDEM/2007/FOSDEM2007-TurboCachingLinuxWithMono.ogg">talk</a> on Mono at FOSDEM. If you're under Windows, maybe need some <a href="http://windowsxp.mvps.org/ogg.htm">help</a> to play it.

<h3>"La deconstrucci&oacute;n del cerebro digital"</h3>
<p>
	For those who want to follow up the talk and couldn't attend it, my father's written down a <a href="http://www.joseantoniocobena.com/?p=195">wide overview</a>. Yesterday, I forgot to mention you can get slides <a href="http://www.cs.us.es/DiNeT/Files/La%20deconstruccion%20del%20cerebro%20digital%20-%20Imaginatica%202007%20-%2005-03-07.zip">here</a>.
