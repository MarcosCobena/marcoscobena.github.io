I've been using them since I was a child, due to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblyopia">lazy eye</a> (I don't know whether it's named in the same way as in Spanish: <span style="font-style: italic;">ojo vago</span>). My first glasses were something similar to a pirate, as one of the lens was blurred to force me to use the lazy side. That was corrected over time.<br /><br />Back to my visit to oculist, in order to analyze the back of my eyes, those had to be dilated. Three times feeling gouts falling in my eyes, three. Even yesterday, Saturday, I was still watching out of focus. Today, everything seems to be clearer.<br /><br />It turns out to be a superb paradox: now that I began to observe, and analyze, everything noticing my perception about reality changes per seconds, I need no more glasses which will help to clarify it. Amazing.
