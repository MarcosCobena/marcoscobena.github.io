It's been a month and a half since I started to dig into the world of Graphic Design. The first module introduced, among other things, the notion of color wheel. And I felt the need to make my-self one of those :-)

I've always kept an eye into <a href="https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp/">SkiaSharp</a>, a cross-platform 2D library to make fast vector graphics. By one side the need, by other the opportunity to play with new stuff. And a few hours later, I have a hue color wheel to discover new palettes, introduce your children into the world of color or simply enjoy the "superb" opening animation.
