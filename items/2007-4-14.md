<h3>Hello, Monologue</h3>
<p>
	Maybe it comes due to work related matters, but this entry had to be named that way.
</p>
<p>
	First of all, thanks to Atsushi Eno, Miguel de Icaza, every Mono hacker who decided we could help this project, Google Summer of Code 2007 folks and everyone related (sorry if I'm forgetting someone) for giving us such a really exciting opportunity here. Really thanks, maybe you can't figure out how we feel now. :'-)

	Following Scott, my name's Marcos Cobe&ntilde;a Mori&aacute;n, a 22 years old Computer Science student at Seville (Andalusia, Spain) who, appart from attending classes, is in love with everything related to 0s and 1s, Computational Neuroscience and everything in between. My summer work's centered on implementing a concrete piece of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) into Mono Olive, WCF stack within Mono. My hack will be done inside System.ServiceModel namespace, and more specifically NetPeerTcpBinding and PeerResolvers.

	As my Blog system is even more lame than Miguel's one, I've just done a quick hack to support categories, so this one, <a href="http://www.youcannoteatbits.org/Blog/SoC.xml">SoC</a>, will contain everything related to my summer work.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, I didn't want to forgive some mates from <a href="http://www.eii.us.es/">High School</a>, <a href="http://ekaia.org/">Ana</a> and <a href="http://penyaskitodice.wordpress.com/">Christian</a> (maybe <a href="http://www.google.es/search?q=Penyaskito&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:es-ES:official&client=firefox-a">Penyaskito</a> looks more familiar), who were also selected for Google Summer of Code 2007, working for <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/debian/about.html">Debian</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/argouml/about.html">ArgoUML</a> respectively. Congratulations guys!
