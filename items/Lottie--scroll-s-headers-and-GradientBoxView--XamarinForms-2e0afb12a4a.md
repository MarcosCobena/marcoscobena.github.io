### Lottie, scrollâ€™s headers and GradientBoxView #XamarinForms

**Monday, 27th  
**Back to the Xamarin.Forms project after holidays :-) Yeray assigned me to polish a task on a Lottie anim. within a splash view â€“the one in charge of logging in silently.

We needed something like Task.WhenAll(lottieAnimation, loggingIn) but Lottie for Xamarin.Forms doesnâ€™t reflect when the anim. ends. I worked on [this PR](https://github.com/martijn00/LottieXamarin/pull/114) which adds a handy OnEnd event for both Android & iOS (anyone out there which would add UWP please?)

In the redesign task am working on have needed again a top view attached to parentâ€™s top, with an underlying ScrollView/ListView flowing below.

Looking for existing NuGets [XFGloss](https://github.com/tbaggett/xfgloss) looked pretty promising, although after playing a little bit with itâ€™s much more complex than my needs. In the end I found some Custom Renderers for Android & iOS through Xamarin Forums and adapted such for a new GradientBoxView, which accepts both a start color and an end one, and is very handy for placing wherever may be needed. Itâ€™s in our minds to publish it from DevsDNA.
