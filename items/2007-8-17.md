	MessageContract's IsWrapped property works now (thanks to Atsushi who
found out what I was missing). By default it's set to true, but
turning it false will avoid formatter to include body content inside a
top wrapper tag. It's extensively used by PeerResolvers.
</p>
<p>
Although PeerResolvers is almost filled (Mono status page shows a 84%
of it done, only some missing stuff I'll complete this weekend), I
can't continue making so much more tests on it, as there have been
some missing pieces needed. Right now a new service instance is
created per incoming message, so there's no state saved, which makes
almost impossible to play with CustomPeerResolverService (I'm working
on it).
</p>
<p>
I'm also working on a proof-of-concept sample which will try to get a
simple chat manually calling CustomPeerResolverService working.

This' been the most visited resource I've worked with this week:
