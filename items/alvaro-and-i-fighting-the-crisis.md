*Álvaro and my-self (carrying my C# t-shirt :-) )*

<a href="https://twitter.com/KimCausierTrans">Kim</a>, a passionate translator who I met while working in <a href="http://workincompany.com">workINcompany</a>, has published an article where <a href="https://twitter.com/reinoso_alvaro">Álvaro</a> and I answer a few questions regarding our app <a href="/apps/buenosdias/">¡Buenos días! aro</a>. I like that thing of "Crisis Busters". I guess it's needed nowadays to look for different ways to solve common problems -like the crisis we're going through, or living with- without loosing our smile.

Today I've noticed <a href="https://twitter.com/J_A_Cobena">my Dad</a> uses the alarm included in the app to remember when to take the next pill... Such are the small things I find beauty on, and push me forward.

<em>Thanks so much Kim!</em> And thanks too because the reason why the app looks native in terms of English language is due to your work. Without asking anything back, truth be told:
