<h3>A nice day to remember</h3>
<p>
	Exactly, one year ago I wrote <a href="http://www.youcannoteatbits.org/Blog/Archives/2006-April.html#Tuesday%2c+April+25%2c+2006">my first entry</a>. I was back from another life, far from previous one, but close to that I'd like to live. It's incredible to see now I've been able to keep this alive for an entire year, full of stories I've lived during those 365 days. I must recognize it's the very first time I've achieved a goal as mantaining a Blog, a lame one, is. I hope to keep this way for many years more. It's for sure a great opportunity to let my *future* children something to read about me.

	However, that isn't all. As probably most of you don't know, there's a reason (well, some more) why I'm called Marcos. It's related to 1975 but, surely, <a href="http://www.joseantoniocobena.com/?p=228">my father's entry</a> will explain it better than me (and yes, I got touched). As I told <a href="http://zifra.blogalia.com/historias/48915">Zifra</a>, I wake up everyday during lot of years with that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Menino.gif">picture</a> close to me, until the point where I really hate everything related to guns, wars, and everything from the same namespace.
