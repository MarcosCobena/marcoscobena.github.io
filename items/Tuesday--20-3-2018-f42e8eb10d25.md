Yesterday I started a 1–2 days task on Microsoft-Xamarin’s [eShopOnContainers](https://github.com/dotnet-architecture/eShopOnContainers) solution. I haven’t heard before of this and it’s a really good opportunity to learn from a globe how to build a full architecture, from client to server sides, made of micro-services —relying on Docker, by the way.

During the afternoon went a few hours back to my other project, and gave final touches to the XAML refactoring I started last week —moving to Control Templates to simplify styling mostly.

I had a comment in one of those entries recommending me to rename font-related styles to something like SmallFontStyle, Medium bla bla bla and so on, and is actually a nice idea, as I’m increasing font-sizes maybe today or tomorrow. He pointed me this as a way to put Designers and Developers in the same road, and I totally agree. Thanks Dani for the feedback!
