	We, Vicente and I, arrived <a href="http://www.youcannoteatbits.org/Blog/Archives/2006-October.html#Wednesday%2c+October+11%2c+2006">there</a> without issues (two o three times we took the wrong way but no more than that). Jes&uacute;s lives on a cool place, close to the beach and very peaceful.

	Driving to the city, we ran into an old car tailback. Thanks to we were carrying a GPS, decided to follow them until stopping at an area where taking photos is easier than in motion.
