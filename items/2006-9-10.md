<h3>Italian Grand Prix</h3>
<p>
	My parents and I were watching <a href="http://www.formula1.com/race/news/4932/765.html">Schumacher announcing his retirement</a> just after the race and noticed he's even more a great driver: he's a great person. I wish him not to leave never ever, as <a href="http://www.joseantoniocobena.com/">my father</a> and I've always enjoyed his races and spirit, but we know it's time to take care of you and your family and, being honest, it makes you still better. Take care, my best wishes. :'-)

	By the way, I'm looking for a free light-weight <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">CMS</a> like <a href="http://www.mojoportal.com/">mojoPortal</a> (better if it's also a wiki on the same box).
