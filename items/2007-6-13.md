	I'm really sorry for not having post firsts reports, but exams have
kept, and will keep, me out during some weeks. :-(
</p>
<p>
	I began working on my project during April, but most of the time was
invested in setting up workspace. You can have a look to my
experiences at: <a href="http://www.youcannoteatbits.org/Blog/Archives/2007-April.html#Saturday%2c+April+21%2c+2007">Building Mono Olive for dummies</a>,
<a href="http://www.youcannoteatbits.org/Blog/Archives/2007-May.html#Friday%2c+May+11%2c+2007">Initial PeerResolvers hacking and check-in</a>
and <a href="http://www.youcannoteatbits.org/Blog/Archives/2007-May.html#Friday%2c+May+18%2c+2007">When you take things easier...</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Currently, some passed exams will let me dedicate some mornings to
keep on with NUnit tests, mainly focused on CustomPeerResolverService,
until I finish my last subject on June 27. By the way, you can have a
wider look to current status at <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mono-soc-2007/web/on-wcf-netpeertcpbinding-and-peerresolvers">my project page</a>.

<p>
	I'd really like to thank all those hackers at <code>#mono</code> and <code>#monosoc</code> who
have always helped me.
