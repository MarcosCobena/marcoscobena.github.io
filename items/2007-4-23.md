<h3>First steps with Mono Olive</h3>
<p>
	As some of you already know, this week is April Fair (or "Feria de Abril, y Ol√©", being those last bits added by me) so I'll spend these mornings investigating on olive module, mainly writting tests. I've noticed my Unix-knowledge was a little bit hidden somewhere at my large cortex, so it's time to repair this.

	As I've kept on finding new tips when working, have updated my book-attempt <a href="http://www.youcannoteatbits.org/Blog/Archives/2007-April.html#Saturday%2c+April+21%2c+2007">Building Mono Olive for dummies</a> (Google bombing would be fine here). If it keeps growing, surely will end moving it to Mono Site.
