	Not finished yet, but we've decided to start moving pieces in the right way. Today, you can visit our <a href="http://www.cs.us.es/DiNeT">Web Site</a> (not working right now, server fallen) and <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/dinet">IRC channel</a> (you'll reach me connected on Monday-Friday during mornings, GMT+1).
</p>
<p>
	If nothing goes wrong, we'll start giving <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2500845581503718756&q=jeff+hawkins">lectures</a> on October. More to come, keep connected. :-)
