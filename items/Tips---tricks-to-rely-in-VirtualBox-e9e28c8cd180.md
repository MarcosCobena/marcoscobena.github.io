### Tips & tricks to rely in VirtualBox

During the last years my VM needs were so much covered by Parallels and VMWare. Both are super reliable and, obviously, imply a cost. In that time too I‚Äôve tried several times [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org), but always ended in the virtual HD corrupted so losing all inside. No good.

One month ago I gave it again a try. And, don‚Äôt want to say it loudly, have had zero issues from then. Moreover, I think don‚Äôt need the other solutions anymore.

VirtualBox‚Äô a little bit more manual, and doesn‚Äôt have the Parallels mode where guest‚Äô OS blends with host one ‚ÄîCoherence?; however, with some good tips, covers all my daily needs. Take into account am a macOS user which need Windows 10 virtualized, mostly to develop.

  * After trying the different options, the most I feel comfortable with is having the VM window at its maximum size to fit screen bounds ‚Äînot maximized as macOS understand. In that case, pressing CMD once and moving to other desktops with CTRL + ‚Üê/‚Üí feels nice ‚Äîforgot to mention I commonly use three virtual desktops: main work, VM and Spotify üòé
  * Maybe it‚Äôs because of my previous experiences, but I try to shut down the VM with Start, Shut down‚Ä¶ I know am losing the magic pause options VM use to have, but gives more confidence the other way around
  * The [VM VirtualBox Extension Pack](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)‚Äôs a must. I needed that to support USB sticks but know it empowers the guest in some other ways tooI‚Äôm sure forgetting something but will continue editing this as it comes to my mind. If you have any other tip please share it as well ‚Äîthanks in advance!
