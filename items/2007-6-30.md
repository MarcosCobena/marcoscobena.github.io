<h3> System.ServiceModel, NetPeerTcpBinding Class and System.ServiceModel.PeerResolvers. Weekly Status Report #{4, 5}</h3>
<p>

	Exams finished! This week I've had my last exam, so I'm ready for a
nice hacking summer. :-D
</p>
<p>
	I've uploaded some more classes to System.ServiceModel.PeerResolvers,
which's almost fully populated, among some fixes to
CustomPeerResolverService for fitting NUnit tests against .NET
version.
</p>
<p>
	I've never made before NUnit tests for communication stuff, so I've
noticed it's actually difficult to test this sort of code within this
way. As I think I can't do so much more without putting code in real
scenarios, I'll go for NetPeerTcpBinding so I can start mixing my two
puzzle pieces up. This will be my next immediate goal.
</p>
<p>
	I really love feedback, so any help is really appreciated. :-)
</p>
<p>
	Before leaving, I'd also like to congratulate Moonlight hackers for
such an incredible work done in twenty-one (21) days. Screenshots and
videos have kept us excited these last weeks. Congratulations, really
really really great job!
