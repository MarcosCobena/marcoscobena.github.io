It has been more than a year since I switched to a low-end smartphone. As a Software Engineer, I have always thought having the last and best was an actual need, in order to be "updated"; however, nowadays, I think it is not that case anymore, actually the opposite. Obviously it is far from perfect but, really good for my actual needs.

By March-April 2024 I seriously started looking for Android smartphones with a 5' screen. I was bored of those extra large ones, see 6', which are hard to work with one hand and do not fit in almost any pocket. Also, I did not want to pay more than 200 € for it \-my two latest devices have been two Redmi/Xiaomi from that range and worked just fine.

One year or more ago I also read Digital minimalism (Cal Newport), which made me wish I could spend less time with my smartphone.

On 10th June 2024, I wrote down in my agenda:

> Must-have smartphone:  
> Aprox. size: iPhone 6 (\~5'') 13.81x6.7x0.69 cm 129 g  
> Android  
> Jack 3.5 mm  
> Cameras \>= 8 Mp (rear), 1.2 Mp (front)  
> 2 GB RAM  
> ~~64~~32 GB ROM  
> ~~Gyroscope~~

It is curious how I ended up acepting the loss of the last two items :-D

Basically, I found two main choices:

- middle-end devices from Unihertz with 3' screens  
- low-end ones from a bunch of companies

I was scared of losing my eyes with the first one so I went with the second. I bought an Alcatel B1 2022 for 50 €.

# Cons

## Performance

When I started using it I noticed it was a bit slow. Given the specifications it was actually expected. However, I think I read it on XDA forums, one key aspect which makes Android devices feel that way is the virtual keyboard, and they recommended changing it for a lighter alternative. I found “Simple Keyboard” in the Play Store (which, by the way, is Free Software too :-) ) and the entire OS started to feel much better.

## Pre-installed apps

Since I could not uninstall everything I wanted, I discovered one can disable most of the stock apps: Calendar (we rely on a paper calendar since a few years), Chrome (I installed Firefox Focus instead), Search (disabling too the always-in widget in the main screen), etc. I want to see just the apps that are useful for me.

## Gyroscope

With all the kidding I had with my wife because a phone she had did not include a gyroscope, I thought I was going to miss it a lot. But no. Everytime we travel somewhere by car I use my phone as GPS with Google Maps and, I have not noticed the lack of a gyroscope. If I am using directions while walking, I may notice it at the very beginning, because once I start walking the app can calculate where I am heading giving my direction vector.

## NFC

I used to pay with it on my previous smartphone but it was actually a commodity, nothing serious. I have even ended up liking the idea of sticking to the plastic cards because it means I must always carry them with me as well, mostly for the identification ones.

## Fast charging

I should say as well I do not see my-self charging it on a daily basis  but, it also takes a few hours to charge at 100%. We try to avoid leaving them charging during night so I plug it mostly while I am working at home.

## Screen brightness

I do not know exactly which type of screen it has but it is quite difficult to read anything on it under the sun. It neither has auto-levelling of brightness. In the very beginning I had some sort of script to decrease the brightness at night and the opposite in the morning. I ended up not using such, it failed from time to time (I guess being Android Go, background services are limited at some extent).

# Pros

## Footprint

It is nice to carry a smaller device. Since I am not so worried about it, I removed the case I initially put, making it even smaller. It fits on every pocket I have and, you can not see from the outside anything of it. I have started carrying it on the back side, it feels more comfortable while walking.

## Battery life

Actually, its capacity is smaller compared to the ones I used to have, given the smaller size of its body. However, since I use it less, and I guess the screen demands less energy due to its size, I use to have three (sometimes up to four) days between charges, which feels good.

# Others

## Audio jack

Although I can listen to music and podcasts, I can not attend a call with the headset: there is a non-ending noise which does not allow anyone to hear my voice. I noticed this a few months later after buying it, but I have never sent it for repair. I simply hold my phone next to the ear or, when it takes longer, I turn the speaker on. I could try Bluetooth too.

## Pictures

One thing I like to say my-self when I want a new smartphone is having good cameras because this way I will take super-beautiful pictures of my children, travels, etc. Pictures which I will rarely watch again, in most of the cases.

However, given the camera specifications I got, I have been surprised how they are not so important in the end. I can see pictures I have taken of my children which are impressive (for me hehe). Yes, I can not print them to cover a building pixel-perfect but, I do not need it. What I pursue is the memory of when I took it, not its quality somehow.

When I tell others my phone took 50 € they get surprised. I think some of them feel I am lately having trouble with money, some I just do not want to spend any of it. Since becoming a father there is something inside me which has leveraged the need to find the actual value in everything. In the end this has taken me trying to understand what I actually need to live. Also, I want to send a message to my children, I guess.
