<h3>Feiertage</h3>
<p>
	Last exams, work, and so on, have kept me busy during last month. Now, it's time to enjoy. :-)
</p>
<p>
	In August 5-10, my parents and I will travel to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna">Vienna (Austria)</a> in order to visit some places where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart">Mozart</a> used to live and play.

<h3>Almu&ntilde;&eacute;car</h3>
<p>
	Thanks to my friend Vicente's family, Jes&uacute;s and I have spent some days in this <a href="http://www.almunecar.info/">beautiful town</a>. You can take a look to some photos at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcoscobena/">my Flickr page</a> (must be registered and marked as a friend - if not, ask me for).

<h3>DiNeT</h3>
<p>
	This is the acronym for one of my last dreams. I've been working on it during my [not much] free time those last months, close to some more people (really thanks for your effort), and we hope to release it public as soon as possible. ;-)
