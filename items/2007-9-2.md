	Here it's, my developer's notebook attempt, you can <a href="/Files/Mono%20Olive%20Notebook%20-%2018-09-07.pdf">download it</a>. I attach my acknowledgement which "sums up" my thanks to all of you:

I've followed the Mono Project since the very beginning, when the
project didn't even exist. There were only a handful of entries at
Miguel de Icaza's Blog (http://tirania.org/blog/) talking about a new
C# compiler he was working on. Over the years, the project was
completed. Nowadays, hundreds of people around the world contribute
to the effort of porting .NET, and to increase its library
stack.

It's been exciting to feel me part of this large mesh of people that
contribute to the Mono effort. Just feeling someone located in
somewhere around the world is using code that I've written makes
one happy. And there's no money that can buy this.

There's so much people I'd like to thank... Without a defined order
(just the one my cortex applies): thanks to my family and friends,
those I keep sharing time with and also those I used to, for daily
understanding I love computers since I'm child, and for keeping
close after days and days of I'm sorry, I can't go out, I have no time,
specially to my soul mate Luis Serrano Domínguez; thanks to my
.NET Club mates, who have been crucial for me in both my personal
and professional life, both changed when all this started, I love
all of you; thanks to Microsoft whole support team, who I worked
with as if a dream it was, specially to Alejandro Campos Magencio,
David Salgado Bermejo, Ignacio Alonso Portillo, Javier Melero Gallego,
Sacha Arozarena Valladares and Distributed Services Europe
Core Team (We're Service Oriented!), where Dominique Pochat introduced
me into COM, COM+ and DCOM debugging precious
world, I'll never forget all of you.

Thanks to Rafael Corchuelo Gil, my tutor, for his unfordable help
on this document, his superb daily conferences during software engineering
class hours and his back-end job on students like me who
love what we do, I wish there were more teachers like him; thanks
to María José Hidalgo Doblado and José Antonio Alonso Jiménez,
from Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Department at
University of Seville, for letting me visit their offices during nonworking
hours, they've always let me their door open; thanks to
David Guerrero Martos and Paulino Ruiz de Clavijo, from Electronic
Technology Department at University of Seville, for their help
since my first years at High School.

I'd like to thank those who have helped me checking this document:
Miguel de Icaza and Teresa Matamoros Casas. They surprisingly
took my writings and sent me back a handful of corrections.
Thanks guys.

Finally, I'd like to thank Google for such a beautiful program as
Summer of Code is, and Atsushi Enomoto, Miguel de Icaza and
every Mono programmer for their support during this summer.
Huge, huge, huge thanks.

It's been thrilling, I'm pretty sure that I'll never forget this summer.
