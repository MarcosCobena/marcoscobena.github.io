<h3>Devil's Day</h3>
<p>
	However, in the end it hasn't been as evil as I though. Better said, it has been a quite nice one: some e-mails from friends (one of them telling me he's passed a programming exam I used to help him with, you rock dude :-D), my Mum and I have gone to buy some gifts for <a href="http://www.joseantoniocobena.com/">Dad</a> (tomorrow he'll be 59), one mate has just told me I passed another subject (you rock too as well, thanks guy), and so on.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Please, I need your help</h3>
<p>
	Tomorrow, my lovely father will be one more year-old and I'd like to do something kind of special to celebrate it. Here is my idea:
	<ol>
		<li>Visit his <a href="http://www.joseantoniocobena.com/">Web</a>.</li>
		<li>Just comment on one of his entries, for example the <a href="http://www.joseantoniocobena.com/?p=105">last one</a>.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>
	Note: It doesn't even matter if you do it in English, German, Spanish, etc. I compromise to translate him every of them. :-)
</p>
<p>
	Really, really, really, thanks in advance...
