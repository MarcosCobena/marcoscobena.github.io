It turns out [the fix](/?i=2018-1-19) I found last day to
fix SSH connection with GitHub applies equally to Visual Studio Team Services:
the SSH agent was missing the key I created specifically for it. So,
SourceTree’s fully working with my multi-keys env. SSH ✌️

Looking for something in Google came up to a Xamarin.Forms app where navigation
was being handled entirely through messaging, and the actual code in charge of
pushing and popping pages placed at main `App`’s code behind.

You ask for navigation like:

`MessagingCenter.Send(new NavigationMessage { PageType = typeof(YourPageToGo)},
NavigationMessageTitle);`

; and receive it in the same way:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    MessagingCenter.Subscribe<NavigationMessage>(this, NavigationMessageTitle, message =>
    {
        switch (message.PageType)
        {
            case typeof(YourPageToGo):
                var page = new YourPageToGo();
                MainPage.Navigation.PushAsync(page);
                break;
            [...]
        }
    });
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I have some concerns regarding awaiting the navigation to happen, since your
loose that. However, it’s something which could be workaround-ed.

It always recalls my attention what it’s possible to achieve with vanilla
Xamarin.Forms, without MVVM frameworks, just using what you already have.
