<h3>I keep breathing</h3>

	I apologize for my long time without writing here, I've been busy with High School first week.
</p>
<p>
	Right now, I'm checking latest Mono sources in order to be back to hacking time. I removed previous version for getting a cleaner one but, shame on me, I also deleted my private key paired to my contributor account. I know, I know, a newbie issue, I forgot to back that up. Miguel reactivated my account with a new key and it works like a charm. Thanks dude.

	Yesterday, I went to bed with the announce of Mono Summit hosting at Madrid (yeah!). I'll try to be there, almost sure, one or two days. I wonder if my mates from SoC will be there also, we could organize a talk on contributing or similar. Please, if you read this, drop me a text.

	P.S.: I have to buy some spanish olives with olive oil for Eno, as I promised. I may go for two pieces, Miguel also loves olive oil.

	P.S. 1: My Final Project got a ten (10). I think I still don't fully believe it, I never got such mark during High School years.
