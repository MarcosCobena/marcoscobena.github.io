Boys, on Saturday we went to the cinema and watched Flow. Mom and I took that decission in a hurry to scape from a bunch of days at home due to the bad weather.

You may remember it because "there was a cat which was scared of some dogs", or because Mom had a small bag of candies which spent us in a piecemeal. I will remember it because, waiting to enter the room, I noticed Flow was made with Blender.

Blender is software (what Dad does when he goes into the study room!) free. You are too young to understand the meaning of free. It means anyone can use it without doing bad things, without hurting anyone else. It also means anyone can repair it if it breaks, instead of throwing it to the bin. You may want to draw images in the computer with Blender in a future.

I want you to know the world you are going to live is mostly driven by money, those rounded things you ask us for a bag of chips from time to time. However, there is really good people out there, like the ones who create Blender, who move by helping others first.
