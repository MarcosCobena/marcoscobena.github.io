<h3>On "Sevillian intelligence"</h3>
<p>
	Yes, <a href="http://www.mindhacks.com/blog/2006/09/sevillian_intelligen.html">exciting</a>. For <a href="http://jorgemagic.blogspot.com/">Jorge</a> and me, it was like having <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> in front of us and answering to every doubt we could have about his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity">Theory of Relativity</a>.
</p>
<p>
	We meet <a href="http://internal.iop.kcl.ac.uk/ipublic/staff/profile/external.aspx?go=10947">Vaughan</a> on Monday afternoon, about 20.00 GMT+1. Having some orange juices we spent close to three hours discussing on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex">cortex</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron">neurons</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_memory">LTM</a> (Long-term Memory) and so on. At the end, I made him one question: when he expects the brain to be fully discovered from its biological point of view. His answer: thousand of years...
</p>
<p>
	Jorge is collecting some Q&A we made to Vaughan in order to clarify a little bit more our, for now inexperienced, vision of the brain. He'll send it to our <a href="http://listas.us.es/mailman/listinfo/dinet">mailing list</a> as soon as possible. Stay tuned!
</p>
<p>
	Honestly, I don't know when, or where, we'll have again the opportunity to spend some time talking with Vaughan, but I'd like it to be as soon as possible. Thanks dude. ;-)

<h3>New gadget</h3>

	<a href="http://www.nokia.es/telefonos/modelos/nokia_e61/index_ide61.jsp">Nokia E61</a>. Probably, the best everything-on-the-same-box device I've ever had.
