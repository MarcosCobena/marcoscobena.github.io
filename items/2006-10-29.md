<h3>Moving to Google Reader</h3>
<p>
	I've been using <a href="http://www.rssbandit.org/">RSS Bandit</a> for a while, but its memory leaks (among other things) have made me change to Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">one</a>. Simple: export your feed list using OPML format (XML based), and import it into your Google account. Just one thing to mention, I don't know why but importing categorized feeds with folders into Google Reader shows them repeated. To *fix* (subjectively talking) this, manually delete every category from the OPML and import it again.

	In addition, it <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/m">goes mobile</a> too.

<h3>Brain lecture</h3>
<p>
	Tomorrow, I'll be attending <a href="http://www.upo.es/depa/webdex/nrb/DIVISION/JMsp.htm">Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Delgado</a>'s conference on the brain; it'll be quite interesting, for sure.
