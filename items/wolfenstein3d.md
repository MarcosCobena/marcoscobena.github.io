I do not know what I discovered first: whether Fabien Sanglard's black books or his blog.
Anyway, I was absolutely in with how Wolfenstein 3D was made,
and started to try reproducing its engine by 2019.
With the main help of Fabien's explanation of the ray-casting technique, I went back to high school trigonometry.
After a failed attempt, and a gap of 4 years, I finally got it!
Thank you Fabien for such a wonderfull book.
The room where you can move is our current storey at Plain Concepts Sevilla :-)
