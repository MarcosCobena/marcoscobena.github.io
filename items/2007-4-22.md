<h3>The Question</h3>
<p>
	This week, thirty-two people died at Virginia and this new is everywhere around the world. This same week, more than two hundred (200) people has died at Irak, this morning seventeen more right there, and the most probably is tomorrow will die some more at the same place, almost sure; but we'll keep on talking about first ones. What happens?

	I think know the answer...
