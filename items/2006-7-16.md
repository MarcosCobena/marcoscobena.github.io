<h3>French Grand Prix</h3>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.fernandoalonso.com/">Fernando</a> couldn't win, but finished in a great second place, and the best thing, <a href="http://www.pedrodelarosa.com/">Pedro</a> is back. I can't stop imaging these two drivers working for the same <a href="http://www.mclaren.com/">team</a> next year... :-)
