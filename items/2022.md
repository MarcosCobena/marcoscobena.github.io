After reading [Dani’s year recap](https://danigm.net/2022.html), I have felt the need to write mine down too.

However, I am not right now as creative as I would like; instead, I have came up with this list of intents which I will not achieve:

- Shut my-self up more often during video calls: better listen what others have to say
- Less Google, more documentation: I want to achieve great things in the long-term, not today nor tomorrow
- Refactor first or after, not in the middle: no more bloated commits
- Wake up earlier! Somewhat difficult with two babies :-)
- More writting thoughts down: I think have found Mastodon really helpful here, but still exploring it
- Accept I can not change a lot of things: appreciate I can change a really small subset
- Focus on what I can change, trust on others taking care of the rest: I suffer a lot of “it will fail if I do not manage it my-self”
- Read more to fall in love with problems: it makes the road a joy, and sometimes you solve them
- Do not stay sit down periods longer than 1 h

And that’s it.
