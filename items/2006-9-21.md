<h3>Time to read</h3>
<p>
	This morning I've received some books <a href="http://www.joseantoniocobena.com/">my father</a> and I bought at Amazon last week:
	
	<ul>
		<li>1 of: Multiple Intelligences: New Horizons (my father's one)</li>
		<li>1 of: The Birth Of The Mind: How A Tiny Number of Genes Creates the Complexities of Human Thought</li>
		<li>1 of: Mono (Developer's Notebook) [Illustrated]</li>
		<li>1 of: Head First Design Patterns (Head First) [Illustrated]</li>
		<li>1 of: Professional .NET Framework 2.0 (Programmer to Programmer)</li>
	</ul>

	Now, I only need free time to read them.

<h3>On Kohonen Neural Networks (and porting Java to .NET)</h3>
<p>
	This morning mates from <a href="http://www.youcannoteatbits.org/DiNeT/">DiNeT</a> had a meeting, just after visiting <a href="http://www.upo.es/depa/webdex/nrb/DIVISION/JMsp.htm">Jos&eacute; Mar&iacute;a Delgado Garc&iacute;a</a>. Jorge Moreno showed us (<a href="http://jorgemagic.blogspot.com/">Jorge Cant&oacute;n</a> and I) how he was using those networks in order to achieve some goals for his own job. He suggested we could start modelling different layers, at cortex, based on this theory.
</p>
<p>
	Some hours later, Jorge C. sent an <a href="http://listas.us.es/pipermail/dinet/2006-September/000038.html">e-mail</a> to the mailing list pointing to <a href="http://jknnl.sourceforge.net/">Java Kohonen Neural Network Library (JKNNL)</a>. It seems to be a good starting point so we've started to play a little bit with it. There's only an *issue*: it's made for Java (well, there's no problem at all, but those who know me will have ever noticed I love Microsoft .NET/Mono platforms). :-)
</p>
	Let's start. As I haven't installed <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">JDK</a> in my machine, Jorge C. has build JKNNL into a <code>JAR</code> for me. When you build Java source code, its compiler (<code>javac</code>) produces some <code>CLASS</code> files, which are basically bytecodes for JVM (Java Virtual Machine). As it's natural, .NET runtime doesn't understand them (neither in the other way). But well, it's currently not absolutelly true, .NET runtime can consume Java bytecode, thanks to <a href="http://www.ikvm.net/">IKVM</a>. You can perform some actions (as can be read <a href="http://www.ikvm.net/uses.html">here</a>), but we'll have a look to converting Java bytecode to .NET IL.
</p>
<p>
	First step is converting <code>JAR</code> file to a <code>DLL</code> assembly.
	
	<pre>
C:\Documents and Settings\Marcos\Escritorio\Temporal\Digital Neuroscience Team (
DiNeT)\Java Kohonen Neural Network Library (JKNNL)>ikvmc jknnl.jar
Note: output file is "jknnl.dll"
Note: automatically adding reference to "C:\ARCHIV~1\MONO-1~1.1\lib\ikvm\IKVM.GN
U.Classpath.dll"
	</pre>
</p>
<p>
	As you can see, it generates a <code>DLL</code>. Using <code>monodis</code> we can check it's properly built and belongs to .NET assemblies world. Now we're prepared for referencing and using it into our own code.

<p>
	Time to code. Based on JKNNL <a href="http://jknnl.sourceforge.net/tutorial.html">tutorial</a>, I've created a very basic <code>Main</code> method just to check <code>DLL</code> works fine. It simply creates a Kohonen network (with its settings) and uses some patterns from a <code>TXT</code> file for learning.

	<pre>
using System;

using topology;
using network;
using learningFactorFunctional;
using kohonen;
using metrics;

class Tutorial
{
	public static void Main()
	{
		MatrixTopology topology = new MatrixTopology(5, 10);
		double[] maxWeight = {200, 100};
		DefaultNetwork network = new DefaultNetwork(2, maxWeight, topology);
		ConstantFunctionalFactor constantFactor = new ConstantFunctionalFactor(0.8);
		LearningData fileData = new LearningData("Training.txt");
		WTALearningFunction learning = new WTALearningFunction(network, 20, new EuclidesMetric(), fileData, constantFactor);
		learning.learn();
		Console.WriteLine(network);
	}
}
	</pre>
</p>
<p>
	Once created and saved <code>CS</code> file, we build it referencing <code>jknnl.dll</code> (please notice I'm also referencing <code>IKVM.GNU.Classpath.dll</code> as it's needed for understanding Java code: classes, methods, types and so on). As expected, we'll obtain an <code>EXE</code> assembly which, if nothing goes wrong, must works fine on Mono (and also Microsoft .NET).

<p>
	As final step (you can appreciate I've been some months working with Wizards on ASP.NET 2.0 :-P), we call Mono to load our assembly and... It works! :-D

	As final test, in order to sleep fine today, we can try to run it under Microsoft .NET runtime and, again, it works. :-)

<p>
	Summing up: out-of-the-box.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Update:</b> I forgot to mention I also had to copy <code>IKVM.Runtime.dll</code> and <code>ikvm-native.dll</code> assemblies into application folder (you also can add those files to GAC, same behaviour).
