Those I use to work with in my daily job, mostly while developing apps:

 

**Android File Transfer** —self-explanatory

<https://www.android.com/filetransfer/>

 

**BetterSnapTools** —I like a lot how Windows adapts such when taken into edges
and this makes exactly the same on macOS. Worth the price

<https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12>

 

**Device Metrics** —idem as (1)

<https://material.io/devices/>

 

**Disk Inventory X** —app to show a tree map with directories size, very handy
for debugging where the hell an app is taking so much space in disk

<http://www.derlien.com/>

 

**DPI love (1)** —which DPI a specific device has

<http://dpi.lv/>

 

**GIF speed changer** —when Designers send me GIFs to showcase what they’re
pretending I find really useful to decrease motion to perceive small details

<https://ezgif.com/speed/>

 

**gimp-android-xdpi** —plug-in to export current image into multiple Android
densities (Target DP Width is that which will have in mdpi) 

<https://github.com/ncornette/gimp-android-xdpi>

NOTE: in macOS, place the plug-in under `/Users/marcos/Library/Application
Support/GIMP/2.8/modules`.

 

**Vysor** —the best way I know to work as with an emulator but on an actual
Android device, worth purchasing

<https://www.vysor.io/>

 

### Visual Studio for Mac

If not said explicitly these are available through existing repositories at
Visual Studio \> Extensions… \> Gallery.

**MS Solution Launcher** —multiple instances of Visual Studio at the same time

<https://github.com/Redth/MSSolutionLauncher>

 

**Redth’s Addins (IDE extensions)** —I can’t imagine VS withouth the Obliterate
output paths menu option: removes every bin/obj folder
