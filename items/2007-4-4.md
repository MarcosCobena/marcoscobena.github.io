<h3>On holidays, day 2</h3>
<p>
	00.50 AM. We've spent the whole day at the beach. Weather hasn't been the best thing available but, although without getting into water, playing tennis and taking photos have taken us busy.

	For dinner, some pizzas at La Antilla have let me discover world seems to be smaller than I used to think: <a href="http://edhelnature.bitacoras.com/">&Aacute;lvaro</a>, Gonzalo and <a href="http://www.fearuth.net/">Pablo</a> were sat down close to us. They're some friends who shared with me last years at institute. Nice to see them again...
