There should be a connection between those things.<br /><br />In fact, there's one. Studying information activates the left brain, while music does the same with the right side. Playing an instrument, for instance, enables both sides at the same time, which results on a more capable brain to gather and process information. Cool.<br /><br />This recalls me I've recently read in somewhere about special tickets (for students, I guess) for classical music concerts. Shame on me I didn't write it down.
