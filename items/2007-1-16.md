<h3>LOVE: The connected lives of The Beatles, technology and friendship</h3>
<p>
	On Monday, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ethelcilla/">Ethel</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/DavidSalgado/">David</a> arrived at Seville to give <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/spanish/msdn/estudiantes/eventos/universitytour.mspx">University Tour 2007</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/spain/business/launch2007/default.mspx">LOVE</a> (Exchange Server 2007, Windows Vista and Office 2007 Launchs) talks. It's been some months since the last time I saw David, so it was nice to check working toguether makes people to buy almost the same glasses (Ethel has the prove). :-)
</p>
<p>
	They picked up a car, left things at the hotel and we went to have dinner with some more folks. Between personal experiences, jokes, bad jokes (mines) and hacking techniques (this happens when you're sat down close to <a href="http://elladodelmal.blogspot.com/">Chema</a>) we spent a great time toguether.
</p>
<p>
	Today, UT 2007 talks were hosted at my School, with a great number of people enrolled and some more who came after. Great talks and demos from my mates, who showed us how interesting are incoming months for .NET community. Just after having lunch, we took the car to LOVE talks. Some <a href="http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/">MVPs</a> were showing incoming products, helped by David with exciting demos. I really enjoyed <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663324.aspx">WCF</a> (we could check <a href="http://www.neuber.com/taskmanager/process/msdtc.exe.html">MSDTC</a> is still alive, although WCF uses no COM+) and <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa663326.aspx">WPF</a> ones.

	Just to finish, I'd like to mention <a href="http://www.beatles.com/">The Beatles</a>. I've listened them before, but never got a CD. Christmas Eve have brought me <a href="http://www.thebeatles.com/hub/love/site/">LOVE</a>, and the openning song fits perfectly here:
	<pre>
Aaaaaahhhhhh...

Because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round...aaaaaahhhhhh

Because the wind is high it blows my mind
Because the wind is high...aaaaaaaahhhh

<b>LOVE is all, LOVE is new
LOVE is all, LOVE is you</b>

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue...aaaaaaaahhhh

Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh...
Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh...
Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh...
	</pre>
</p>
<p>
	Peace and love for everyone.
