<h3>First impressions</h3>
<p>
	OK, it's been just first week but enough to realize new subjects are quite a lot interesting. Again, back to use <a href="http://www.java.com/">Java</a> as default laboratory language, <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> (cute changes since last time I used it) and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> as default IDEs, and white paper and black pen as default editor (lack of just-in-time syntax highlighting). ;-)

<h3>DGIS</h3>
<p>
	I think have never talked about it in depth before, but since I came <a href="/Blog/Archives/2006-April.html#Wednesday%2c+April+26%2c+2006">back from Madrid</a> have been working on this topic.
</p>
<p>
	Basically, it's everything about a Web <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_Information_System">GIS</a> (Geographic Information System) embeded into a *huge* management application. Our <a href="http://www.ebd.csic.es/">customer</a>, needed to obtain some information related to places, picking it out and ranking it. Once done this, you can easily search for one of them (same way as you use Google), and paint it into a map differencing the one previously selected from those which have something common to it.
</p>
<p>
	As customer had their own satellite pictures, we decided to use <a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/">MapServer</a> as server side, managing large image files (more than 200 MBytes each one, 1 GByte perhaps) and cutting it down into smaller pieces. For client side, appart from using ASP.NET 2.0 + C# as default, we discovered <a href="http://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a> ("... makes it easy to put a dynamic map in any web page. It can display map tiles and markers loaded from any source...") which, by creating WMS queries dinamically, gives a smooth sensation when navigating through the map. Must say both MapServer and OpenLayers developers have always helped us to achieve our goals; really thanks for your support.
</p>
<p>
	Everything good has an end. I decided to continue this year with my (lovely) studies so <a href="/Blog/Archives/2006-September.html#Saturday%2c+September+30%2c+2006">I left the job last week</a>; now my mate <a href="http://penyaskitodice.wordpress.com/">Christian</a> will continue to make it much more better.
