	SoC 2007 coding time ends on Monday. Three months have passed since we started with our projects, time goes by so fast! I didn't want to pass up the opportunity to say thanks.
</p>
<p>
	Here's a brief summary of my current contributions to Olive:
	<ul>
		<li>System.ServiceModel.PeerResolvers namespace is almost finished. It hasn't been an easy task due to lack of documentation (neither my WCF book was received from Amazon...), and unsupported pieces which were, and are, needed to get it fully working. I've spent most of my time here inside. This namespace is like my baby. :-)</li>
		<li>I've worked on duplex channel stuff (I drawed <a href="/Blog/Archives/2007-July.html#Sunday%2c+July+08%2c+2007">some diagrams</a> on this), more specifically to support TCP communication over TcpTransportBindingElement. It needs more love, but you can <a href="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/olive/samples/services/tcp-transport-binding-element/">try it out</a>.</li>
		<li>Some NUnit tests, minor fixes, and similar, which make Olive a little bit more reliable and equal to RTM as it was some months ago.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	All those changes live in main SVN right now. However, I haven't had enough time to complete one of my two goals. During all this time I've found unsupported parts which have distracted me to dedicate them some time, Olive's WCF still needs lot of love to become a public release. Anyway, it's impresive what a number of programmers which can be counted with the fingers of a single hand have done. Really nice job.
</p>
<p>
	Also, I'm writing some English documentation on Olive (it'll be finished in two weeks). If you'd like to learn WCF basis and use Olive at the same time, it's your opportunity. Also, I'm adding some steps to guide whoever wants to become a contributor. I'll write an entry on this topic.
</p>
<p>
	As my final SoC entry, I wanted to specially thank Atsushi Enomoto, my mentor, for his patience during all this time, his *everyday* help, his coding lessons, etc. Also to whoever has supported me from the huge Mono community. It's exciting to take part in something like this. And, finally, to Google for such a brilliant program. I have no words to describe this experience.
</p>
<p>
	Just, on January, <a href="/Blog/Archives/2007-January.html#Monday%2c+January+01%2c+2007">I wrote down some dreams</a> I'd like to reach, and contributing Mono with some bits was inside the list. Huge thanks...
</p>
<p>
	I keep coding. :-)
