<h3>Christmas looks promising</h3>
<p>
	Yesterday, we finally booked some rooms at Granada (Andalusia, Spain). We'll spend there four days at the end of December, as the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcoscobena/sets/72057594058536665/show/">past year</a>. Due to lack of time, among other things, we couldn't visit some places. Personally, I wouldn't like to miss the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhambra">Alhambra</a> this one.
</p>
<p>
	Great opportunity again for taking new photos, if possible with the new camera (if possible, as we'll be moving the entire day from one place to other and it's not as easy to use as the previous one).
