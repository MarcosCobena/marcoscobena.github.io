Evolve ChatGPT to a virtual avatar for talking with
---------------------------------------------------

*Evoluciona ChatGPT a un avatar virtual con el que poder conversar*, its original title in Spanish.
Our Research Director, Jorge, and I shared our experience working on [Brain](https://www.thera4all.com/), an app to take psychological tests with a 3D avatar powered by ChatGPT, among other technologies.
My slides were focused on the backend side, the orchestrator, with those challenges we found along the way, and how we overcame them.

Bringing Wave Engine to the Web through WebGL & WebAssembly
-----------------------------------------------------------

*Llevando Wave Engine a la web a través de WebGL y WebAssembly*, its original title in Spanish. Along with Wave Engine 
3.0 launch we explained those steps taken into moving such apps into the Web: from how to run C# 
code in the browser to the transpiler implemented for covering the entire WebGL API.

Design should worry us more than code
-------------------------------------

*Nos debería preocupar más el diseño que el código*, its original title in
Spanish. My vision on how working close to people highly capable in Design made
me change the focus from code to UI/UX, everything focused in the Xamarin
ecosystem. (YouTube: [landscape](https://youtu.be/G0uUN0c_MbM) & [with

Expand your skills with Xamarin: from native to cross-platform
--------------------------------------------------------------

In a pure iOS event, my workmate Oriol and I thought Xamarin could leverage them
chances to go cross-platform. We showcased such ways, and built a small agenda
app to demonstrate all these. ([GitHub](https://github.com/DevsDNA/NSSpain2017):
slides and app)

*Missing anything?*
-------------------

I’ve enjoyed spreading knowledge since was attending the University –mostly .NET
and Xamarin, but also other topics–, so feel free to ping me if want to list
here any of my talks from previous years. I’ll try to do my best! Thanks in
advance.
