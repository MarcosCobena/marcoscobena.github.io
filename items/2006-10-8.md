<h3>Japanese Grand Prix</h3>
<p>
	Yeah! <a href="http://www.fernandoalonso.com/">Fernando</a> is again on top, but I wish <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schumacher">Michael</a> not to have retired... <a href="/Blog/Archives/2006-October.html#Sunday%2c+October+01%2c+2006">Again</a>, could not watch the race (put the alarm, but got sleep) so <a href="http://www.joseantoniocobena.com/">my father</a> summed it up for me. He emphasized Michael, once retired, went walking to the pit stop and thanked each engineer for their help during all the race. That's probably the reason why we, my father and I, love this sport: Team Spirit.

	From <a href="http://www.formula1.com/race/news/5093/768.html">The Official Formula 1 Website</a>, Fernando's interview:
	
	<blockquote>

			<cite>
?<b>This win is a surprise for us all, a beautiful surprise.</b> After qualifying, Ferrari seemed to be a long way in front, but as soon as we started racing today, I could feel that the car was well-balanced, and that we had the same speed as Ferrari. I took a risk to pass Jarno (Trulli) at the start, because it was the only chance, and then later in the stint I could see Ralf (Schumacher) was having problems - and I got a run on him into turn 1. After the second stops, I still thought I could win, because the gap to Michael (Schumacher) was only five seconds, so why not? Then I saw the smoke coming into turn 8, and I was watching the asphalt for oil. I thought it was a Spyker in front of me, and only when I went past did I realise it was Michael. After that, we turned the engine down, and just took things carefully to the finish. <b>This win means a lot to the Renault team, and we have deserved it, and been waiting for it, ever since Hungary. The guys at the track, at the factories in Viry and Enstone, and at Michelin, have never given up all season.</b> Now we feel confident for Brazil - but we are taking nothing for granted. The races are long, and you have to get everything right to make sure you finish in front. We have a good situation for the championship, but we will be racing the same way at Interlagos, to win.?

During reading realised where our efforts to simulate brain activity, and everything rounding us, must (currently it does) tend to: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergence</a>. Don't know how have never noticed before...
