I'm just back from leaving my old video console systems (my babies) on Rosa's house.<br /><br />Rosa is a [lovely] friend who I shared school room with since... Well, since I can remember. His brother, Mario (maybe <span style="font-style: italic;">rlyeh</span> sounds more familiar), is a video games enthusiast and one of the best emulation-related-stuff (and everything in relation with C) developers I've ever met, honestly. Whether you believe me or not, go on and visit <a href="http://www.retrodev.info/">one of his Web sites</a> and check it your-self (yes, he's working on twelve, 12, emulators simultaneously).<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_z2FqY6j3nZs/R3vcEJ82b_I/AAAAAAAAA5g/phag0E44-D0/s1600-h/fGB32screen.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_z2FqY6j3nZs/R3vcEJ82b_I/AAAAAAAAA5g/phag0E44-D0/s400/fGB32screen.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5150952562777026546" border="0" /></a><span style="font-style: italic;">fGB32 logo (please, note top right corner)</span><br /></div><br />Always I visit his site (or talk to his sister) a picture of us during childhood playing with some watches, which included small video games (if my cortex keeps fine, it was a car racing one, and a space invader-like another), waiting on school stairs, comes to my mind. Always.<br /><br />As you can appreciate, I know he'll take care of my babies. Mario, and Rosa, huge thanks in advance.
