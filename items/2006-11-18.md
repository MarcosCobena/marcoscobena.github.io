<h3>Sometimes is fine to miss classes...</h3>
<p>
	... and I could prove, again, it's absolutely true. Last thursday, <a href="http://www.alamedarte.com/jornadas/">UniCienBlog</a> was hosted at the school where I currently study in. Main topic was Blogs, rounded by Science and University. Lot of speakers given out amongst different tables, organized by:
	
	<ul>
		<li><strong>11:00 - Inauguraci&oacute;n</strong></li>
		<li><strong>11:30 - Blogs y Ciberactivismo</strong></li>
		<li><strong>13:00 - Blogs y Mundo Mac</strong></li>
		<li><strong>16:00 - Blogs y Ciencia</strong></li>
		<li><strong>17:15 - Blogs y Software Libre</strong></li>
		<li><strong>18:30 - Blogs y Podcast</strong></li>
		<li><strong>19:45 - Blogs y Universidad</strong></li>
		<li><strong>20:45 - Clausura</strong></li>
	</ul>
	
	I missed two first ones, and the one related to Podcasts, but attended to the entire rest.

	On Blogs and Mac world, I could listen again to <a href="http://www.minid.net/">Diego</a>, great guy with a wonderful vision about what the Web can still do for (and by) us, I've been reading his feed for more than six (6) years now. I liked it, conversations started on Blogs and changed progresively to Apple. I made one question: why, from the student point of view, don't we have Apple's machines at the school? I can't say more, as we have either one. Honestly, I'd really love to have one of those laptops, now that have inside Intel processors, but my question was basically pointed to Apple as a company and their relationships with students (as individuals), and most important, the student community. Ok, they provide discounts (I've recently seen *one* poster at the school announcing you can have an iPod for free, if you buy a laptop before), but we, students, want more than this. We, as programmers will be in a near future, want access to latest technologies, documentation and, the most interesting for me, proximity. I'm sorry, but still Microsoft's much more <a href="http://www.dotnetclubs.com/">closer</a> and Apple (Apple Spain, better said) is light years from this...

	On Blogs and Science, I'd just like to say I'm the happiest guy for having the <a href="http://www.joseantoniocobena.com/">father</a> I've, and thanks to organizers for giving him the opportunity to come back, during some hours, to the place where he'd really like to be in: University. You can read a better description about what they talked about <a href="http://www.alamedarte.com/jornadas/?p=84">here</a>.

	This' the one I most liked, Blogs and University. For me it was like beeing inside <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_is_Beautiful">Life Is Beautiful</a>, having 4-5 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Benigni">Roberto Benigni</a> in front of me explaining and showing how they make students life more beautiful using latest technologies, digitalizing classes, and being closer to students. I wish in a near future, for every student who will join our studies (and every other one), to feel in the classroom the same I felt being there. Thanks. And thanks to organizers for such a great day.
