Those I use to work with in my daily job, mostly while developing apps:

 

**Android File Transfer** —self-explanatory

<https://www.android.com/filetransfer/>

 

**BetterSnapTools** —I like a lot how Windows adapts such when taken into edges
and this makes exactly the same on macOS. Worth the price

<https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/bettersnaptool/id417375580?mt=12>

 

**Charles** —Fiddler for macOS: debug network connections, very useful when
struggling with HTTP calls from an app which doesn’t work as expected

<https://www.charlesproxy.com>

 

**ColorSlurp** —`CMD` + `MAY` + `M` and you’ll get a small magnifier which tells
the color in hex format. Not only it’s handy for such, but also for aligning
things close in pixels

<https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/colorslurp/id1287239339?mt=12>

 

**Device Metrics** —idem as (1)

<https://material.io/devices/>

 

**Disk Inventory X** —app to show a tree map with directories size, very handy
for debugging where the hell an app is taking so much space in disk

<http://www.derlien.com/>

 

**DPI love (1)** —which DPI a specific device has

<http://dpi.lv/>



**Easing Functions Cheat Sheet** —when creating animations I tend to move the mouse over these handy functions to choose which's the one more convenient

<https://easings.net/>

 

**GIF speed changer** —when Designers send me GIFs to showcase what they’re
pretending I find really useful to decrease motion to perceive small details

<https://ezgif.com/speed/>

 

**gimp-android-xdpi** —plug-in to export current image into multiple Android
densities (Target DP Width is that which will have in mdpi) 

<https://github.com/ncornette/gimp-android-xdpi>

NOTE: in macOS, place the plug-in under `/Users/marcos/Library/Application
Support/GIMP/2.8/modules`.

 

**JSON Viewer** —a customer I was working with introduced me this wonderful one,
and like a lot because builds a tree view from any pasted payload, and even
formats it beautifully

<http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/>

 

**Lock Hunter** —if you can’t delete/rename any file/folder in Windows
because someone else’s using it, this’ your tool

<https://lockhunter.com/>

 

**Lorem Pixel** —returns random images categorized through topics and sizes.
Quite useful when outlining UIs which have images. My fuchsia `BoxView`
replacement

<http://lorempixel.com/> (https://picsum.photos/ is my plan b)



**NTFS for Mac** —I've just tried the trial option but makes super easy to work with NTFS drives

https://www.paragon-software.com/ufsdhome/ntfs-mac/

 

**SQLite Browser** —almost every app ends up with a local SQLite DB, and can
explore its content with it

<http://sqlitebrowser.org/>

 

**pidcat** —there’s no need to run Android Device Monitor for just logs, this
CLI tool makes a great job directly from the Terminal. Thanks to [Javi
Pulido](https://twitter.com/pulimento) who introduced me this.

<https://github.com/JakeWharton/pidcat>

NOTE: I had to add Android’s SDK to PATH manually:

`export
PATH=$PATH:/Users/marcos/Library/Developer/Xamarin/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools`

`export
PATH=$PATH:/Users/marcos/Library/Developer/Xamarin/android-sdk-macosx/tools`

- Pulido also wrote [this handy PowerShell script](https://gist.github.com/pulimento/ddd82080232360a49a2e4c751bf16515)



**VirtualBox** —the software I run to virtualize Windows under macOS. I keep
[here](https://medium.com/@MarcosCobena/tips-tricks-to-rely-in-virtualbox-e9e28c8cd180)
all those tips & tricks which make my experience smoother.

<https://www.virtualbox.org/>

- https://github.com/philipnewcomer/macOS-VirtualBox-VM —how to virtualize macOS (you'll need [this](https://mycyberuniverse.com/macos/how-download-complete-macos-high-sierra-installer-app.html) to fetch the entire installer app)



**Vysor** —the best way I know to work as with an emulator but on an actual
Android device, worth purchasing

<https://www.vysor.io/>



### Visual Studio (for Windows)

**Editor Guidelines** —it allows me to add a vertical rule at 120 chars

<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PaulHarrington.EditorGuidelines>



**VisualStudio.GitStashExtension** —adds stashes, that's all

[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vii.GitStashExtension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vii.GitStashExtension)



### Visual Studio for Mac

If not said explicitly these are available through existing repositories at
Visual Studio \> Extensions… \> Gallery.

 

**DeepClean (IDE extensions)** —not only deletes /bin & /obj folders but also
cleans NuGet caches

 

**FiraCode** —an absolute joyful font with beautiful ligatures for things like
`=>`. Just choose it from VS’ Preferences

<https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode>

 

**MS Solution Launcher** —multiple instances of Visual Studio at the same time

<https://github.com/Redth/MSSolutionLauncher>

 

**My custom key bindings** —after years using MonoDevelop, Xamarin Studio and
now Visual Studio for Mac, I’ve finally customized a few key bindings which find
very useful
