Damn.<br /><br />This summer I moved from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/spanish/msdn/vstudio/express/VCS/default.mspx">Visual C# 2005 Express Edition</a> to this one, plus <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/default.mspx">Debugging Tools for Windows</a>, plus <a href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/">SharpDevelop</a> (and <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>, needed for <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Compiling_Mono">building Mono</a>). Nice mix, believe me, but I haven't felt truly comfortable writing code (have debugging).<br /><br />Some days ago, I rediscovered <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a>, which thanks to Miguel and a guy (sorry, I forgot your nickname) from <span style="font-family:courier new;">#mono</span> now draws C# code in a handful of beautiful colors, plus some key-bindings I've learned, plus having Cygwin integrated (replacing <span style="font-family:courier new;">M-x shell</span>), resulting on a wonderful mix.<br /><br />However, I have an issue: having Cygwin running inside Emacs doesn't find, by default, assemblies such like <span style="font-family:courier new;">gmcs</span>, <span style="font-family:courier new;">mono</span>, and so forth.<br /><br />Dear Lazy Web, any idea? For me, it looks like a paths thing. You can have a look to <a href="/#Emacs">my current <span style="font-family:courier new;">.emacs</span></a>. Thanks in advance.<br /><br />I'm getting hungry.
