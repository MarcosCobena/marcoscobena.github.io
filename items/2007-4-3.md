<h3>On holidays, day 1</h3>
<p>
	8.00 AM. I'm sat down at home, just waiting my friends to pick me. We'll spend two days at Islantilla (Huelva), far from city, trafic, university. I needed this.
</p>
<p>
	I'm carrying out my camera, with batteries completely charged, in order to take a beautiful bunch of photos. I've never tried this before, but would like to wake up soon, very soon, 6.00 AM; and just capture those seconds when the Sun rises, over the sea, showing only the upper half of the shape. It's romantic, isn't it?
</p>
<p>
	Yesterday, some mates from Club .NET Sevilla invited me to share lunch toguether. We discussed many topics, but motivation was one of the most exciting. What to do when it just expires? To reinvent.
</p>
<p>
	Lack of motivation cames from the brain, and basically bases on beeing conscious about repeating the same patterns most of the time. And there's the issue, you're aware of every step followed, and knows the one coming after, and after, and after, and so on. Break those patterns, introduce new steps, change orders and points of view, find new this you used to find old.
</p>
<p>
	I'll show you up one example: <a href="http://www.youcannoteatbits.org/Projects.aspx">Amelio</a>. It's surely one of the most useful pieces of code have ever written. Entries, this one, are plain text saved in structured folders, organized by months, and those ones by years. Once Amelio's executed, it renders this you're reading, nothing more.
</p>
<p>
	Surely every Blog system available on-line comes up with thousands of features, dynamic rendering, etc. I've had some Blogs over the years, but after writting two or three entries have end up forgetting them. The reason: again, it isn't easy changing patterns, but Amelio's the one which lets reinvent my-self the way I write here, and there's where motivation borns.

	9.20 AM. I'm picking up luggage, my friends are waiting for me.
