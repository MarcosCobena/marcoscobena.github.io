<h3>I like Operaci&oacute;n Triunfo</h3>
<p>
	Yesterday was the last show. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorena_G%C3%B3mez">Lorena</a>, a beautiful black voice, won the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operaci%C3%B3n_Triunfo">competition</a> with a 50,7 % of votes. She couldn't believe was there, started crying and, although I went to bed soon, am almost sure she didn't stop in some hours.

	I don't know if this happens everywhere, but I've met lot of people who think OT is something bad, which people inside there don't really <strike>like</strike> love music, etc. They consider people who joins this TV program just want to earn money and become rich (among other things). And what's even more, some musicians and singers think in the same way.

	 People uses to forget behind a logo there're humans dreaming... Why?
