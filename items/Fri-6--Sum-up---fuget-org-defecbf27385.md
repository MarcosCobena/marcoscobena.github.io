### Fri 6: Sum up & fuget.org

The end of the week’s here and summing up what have worked on these days, most of time’s been reading other’s source code. Years ago I may have received this task as OK… I’ll do it; nowadays, I see it as a great opportunity to learn how others do the same I daily do.

My mate Javi Suárez’s just introduced me the latest Frank Krueger’s joy: [fuget.org](http://www.fuget.org). It’s immediately came to my mind the idea of picking just those portions of NuGet packages you’re actually interested on and go ahead.

I’ve multiple times had the idea of something simpler than NuGet, but more complex than pasting classes here and there —and stronger by the way. Something similar to JavaScript’s NPM, but maybe having code in IL —have to work the idea out a little bit.
