During half 2015 I published a proof-of-concept app to deliver small pictures a friend of mine, "aro", creates every morning. I was delighted with his work done with those pictures, and I wanted to create the bridge to make them arrive to as much people as possible.

Today, and after almost four months of intense work during our spare time, I'd like to share with all of you we've rebuilt the initial app from scratch, re-imagining it. It's not Xamarin.Forms anymore (at least nowadays), but pure Xamarin.Android. And it has a nice bunch of small details which we believe will borrow one or two smiles. :-)

In order to close the circle of love, and promote the app, we'll send a beautiful e-gift to the person you'd like to make happy on Valentine's Day:

I went two weeks ago to watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2080374/">Steve Jobs</a>, and noticed what we all should know but maybe tend to forget easily: <em>love is the underlying engine in our lives</em>. Elisa is mine, and she deserves some credits here as, <a href="/2015/06/08/my-first-app-published-buenos-dias/" target="_blank">I stated with the other app</a>, she's the reason for being back again. I've made it to wish here "buenos días" (good morning) everyday.

And, if you can't wait for Sunday to be here, can already go and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marcoscobena.buenosdiasaro">grab the app from Play Store</a>.

Thanks to <em>everyone</em> who has helped us in one way or another. We, aro and I, really appreciate it!
