<h3>First lines on computational neuroscience</h3>
<p>
	After having a look to my mate Jorge Moreno's first approach (really impresive) this morning on <a href="http://www.numenta.com/Numenta_HTM_Concepts.pdf">HTM</a> model, I've decided to start playing with my own view a little bit.
</p>
<p>
	It just tries to show my understanding on how our brain should be coded (please notice it's everything on a high level, for now).
	
	<pre>
static void Main(string[] args)
{
	Brain brain = new Brain();

	ICortex cortex = new HTM();

	brain.Cortex = cortex;

	List&lt;ISense&gt; senses = new List&lt;ISense&gt;();
	ISense binary = new Binary();

	senses.Add(binary);
	brain.Senses = senses;

	brain.Connect();

	float[] pattern = {0, 1, 0};

	for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
		binary.ReceivePattern(pattern);

	Console.ReadLine();
}
	</pre>
</p>
<p>
	As you can see, <code>Brain</code> needs, at least, a cortex (for example, <code>HTM</code> could be one supporting <a href="http://www.onintelligence.org/">Jeff</a>'s view) and a list of senses (as well, <code>Binary</code> could be one which just understands 0s and 1s patterns: "000", "001", "010", etc.). Once set, we need to connect each sense to the cortex, as patterns received will be managed by it. Before this last step, each sense, it-self, has to apply some changes to inputs in order to make it easy to use by cortex. I mean, our cortex doesn't understand on colours, nor numbers, nor vehicles, etc. There must be a just-in-time transformation where, it doesn't even matter what we receive, it's always saved in the same way.
