Right now, I'm trying to fix my hackish and ugly implementation for <span style="font-family: courier new;">TcpDuplexSessionChannel</span>, as it isn't currently possible to use both primitives on both sides (it should).<br /><br />For testing purposes, I've updated a sample service which can be found under <a href="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/olive/samples/services/tcp-transport-binding-element/"><span style="font-style: italic;">tcp-transport-binding-element</span> folder</a>. Client side sends a new text-encoded message to service side, and this last answers with a new one.<br /><br />Following Eno guidelines, I'll try to get existing applications running on top of .NET, and find what's missing for porting. (If you have some links with similar bits, please forward them to me.)
