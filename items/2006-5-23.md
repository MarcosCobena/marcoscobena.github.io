	Simply incredible! It's quite exciting to see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcoscobena/sets/72057594141137862/show/">these cars</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcoscobena/sets/72057594142253643/show/">in action</a>.

	Thanks to my friend <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/18326966@N00/">Vicente</a> for taking such a great set, he handles my camera better than me. ;-)

<h3>BlackBerry</h3>
<p>
	I'm "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po-IMg31dJs&search=Sinking#">sinking about</a>" purchasing one of <a href="http://www.vodafone.es/Vodafone/ParticularesPS/ParticularesPS/0,2603,21805,00.html">those</a> beautiful gadgets. I've had once or twice a PDA (read <a href ="http://www.palm.com/">Palm</a> and/or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/pocketpc/default.mspx">Pocket PC</a>) but, honestly, I don't find so useful to be continuously using a pen, or having to recharge the battery every one or two days. Instead of this, you can have "intuitive menu system, familiar QWERTY-style keyboard, and easy-to-read display that make it simple to stay in touch", everything in the same box. :-)
