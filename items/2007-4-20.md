	Yesterday, I finished my last exams until May (know it isn't so much, but something is), so it's time to start organizing everything for SoC.

	As I spend two hours everyday just sat in the bus going and coming to High School, have seized the opportunity to refresh my mind about WCF infrastucture and programming model, thanks to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-INDIGO-David-Pallmann/dp/0735621519/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-9032807-9898357?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1175081745&sr=8-1">this book</a>.

	I'm currently rebuilding mcs and mono modules updated to the last commit, so once finished will start playing with olive one. I'll be back with new bits this weekend.
