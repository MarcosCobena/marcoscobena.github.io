<h3>Initial PeerResolvers hacking and check-in</h3>
<p>
	If you've played with Mono Olive during last days you may have noticed there's already some source inside System.ServiceModel.PeerResolvers: CustomPeerResolverService.cs and IPeerResolverContract.cs.
</p>
<p>
	During this morning, I've kept on working at CustomPeerResolverService, but I've gotten stuck here:
	
	<code>
		<pre>
public static void Main ()
{
		CustomPeerResolverService cprs;
		ServiceHost sh;

		try {
				cprs = new CustomPeerResolverService ();

				cprs.RefreshInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5);
				
				<strong>sh = new ServiceHost(cprs);</strong>
		} catch (Exception e) {
				Console.WriteLine ("[!] {0}", e.Message);
		}
}
		</pre>
	</code>
	
	, when executing bold line. I get this exception:
	
	<code>
		<pre>
[mono-project] $ mono ChatServer.exe
[!] Attempted to get contract type from 'System.ServiceModel.PeerResolvers.Custo
mPeerResolverService' which neither is a service contract nor does it inherit se
rvice contract.
		</pre>
	</code>
</p>
<p>
	Thanks to fing/grep (<code>find . -exec grep "Attempted to get contract type from" '{}' \ ; -print</code>) and Reflector power, I've found which class and method throws it: System.ServiceModel.Description/ContractDescriptionGenerator.cs, GetServiceContractAttribute:
	
	<code>
		<pre>
[...]
if (table.Count == 0)
{
	<strong>throw new InvalidOperationException(string.Format("Attempted to get contract type from '{0}' which neither is a service contract nor does it inherit service contract.", contractType));</strong>
}
[...]
		</pre>
	</code>
	
	, where Reflector's helped me making the job of finding concrete method calls stack:

</p>
<p>
	Oh, I fogot to mention I'm using Reflector with Mono binaries, not Microsoft ones. I know I've the entire source, but sometimes it's faster to find things this way. I'll continue investigating tomorrow, now I've to leave to High School.
