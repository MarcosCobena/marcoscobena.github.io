<h3>Back to Andalusia</h3>
<p>
	Some weeks ago I decided to move back from the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/spain/">dream factory</a> in order to finish my estudies and solve a few personal things. I'm really grateful for your support during all this time; I hope to join it again in a near future.
</p>
<p>	
	It was (is) really nice to come back again to the student life: attending classes, visiting friends (some have won a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/spanish/msdn/estudiantes/eventos/imaginecup2006.asp">competition</a>, <a href="http://www.phobeo.com/">one</a> has joined a new <font color="Blue">C</font><font color="Red">o</font><font color="Yellow">m</font><font color="Blue">p</font><font color="Green">a</font><font color="Red">n</font><font color="Blue">y</font>, there is one in somewhere in the Caribbean region, etc.), <a href="http://www.youcannoteatbits.org/Projects.aspx">coding during nights</a> (:-D), etc. Summing up: free time for lot of other projects.

<h3>AI, brains and cortexes</h3>
<p>
	Thanks to my <a href="http://www.joseantoniocobena.com/">Dad</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sacha">mate</a> for arousing me my passion about human mind. Stay tuned... ;-)

<h3>Molog</h3>
<p>	
	I've been trying to use one of those blogs since a long time ago but I never use to continue them... So, I've coded my own one based on <a href="http://www.tirania.org/">Miguel</a>'s idea. It's pretty simple right now, but covers almost everything I need: simple, off-line and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/">port</a><a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">able</a>.
