<h3>To summarize</h3>
<p>
	2006 has been a nice year, maybe the best one since I remember, full of beautiful feelings, happy memories.
</p>
<p>
	I found out in the brain (digital or not) a reason to keep on dreaming, and there's where am right now, and hope to be for a long time.
</p>
<p>
	I rediscovered friendship, consistent with how I've always felt it: full of proximity and regard.
</p>
<p>
	However, I'm not happy. There's still lot of people, close or not, dying of starvation, without life expectancy. People who just see what they really want to see, looked for ignorance (happiness, as they wrongly think). People just interested in their-selves, and nothing more... There's still so much work to do, but always looking <a href="http://www.joseantoniocobena.com/">straight ahead</a>.

<h3>Beautiful Granada</h3>

	We spent some days on holidays, as the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marcoscobena/sets/72057594058536665/show/">last year</a>, and could finally visit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhambra">Alhambra</a> (if you're planing to do the same, don't forget to book <a href="https://w3.grupobbva.com/SMVE/home.html">tickets</a> before, or you'll miss such a great place).
