<h3>Time goes by...</h3>
<p>
	Two weeks since the last entry, I've been quite busy lately with course stuff.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Digital Neuroscience Team (DiNeT) is moving</h3>
<p>
	If everything goes fine, during this week we'll move the site back to: <a href="http://www.cs.us.es/DiNeT/">http://www.cs.us.es/DiNeT/</a>. In the meantime, you can visit a temporal page.
</p>
<p>
	We'd like to start with lectures as soon as possible, stay tunned.
