<h3>Summing up</h3>
<p>
	I've been busy last days preparing some stuff for my studies and have had no time to write down a little bit about our classes about Mono at Albacete. As previous years, everything went right. We, Javi and I, gave eight hours introducing Mono Framework: ASP.NET stack, ASP.NET Web Services, GTK#, etc. There isn't so much time as we'd like to in order to give a wide overview of the entire architecture but it's enough for each one to take off in .NET world.

	Even though I've personally told this to them, would like to thank <a href="http://labloguera.net/blogs/csharp/default.aspx">C&eacute;sar</a>, <a href="http://labloguera.net/blogs/jonas/default.aspx">Jonas</a>, <a href="http://labloguera.net/members/rtebar.aspx">Ram&oacute;n</a>, <a href="http://labloguera.net/blogs/thempra/default.aspx">Thempra</a>, and every guy from <a href="http://system.albacete.dotnetclubs.com/web/default.aspx">Albacete DotNetClub</a>, who make us to spend some nice days there. Thanks a lot! ;-)

	Travelling back to Seville, stopping at Madrid, we noticed every train going to Andalusia was cancelled due to a huge bean which falled down into the railway track. Oh my God, we didn't sleep more than five hours previous night and the last thing wanted to do is staying one more day out. Calling back to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/davidsalgado/">David</a> for cancelling a dinner that night, he told us was in the same situation, so rented a car and we had the opportunity to share some hours toguether. Without expecting it, we ended visiting <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/spain/">dream factory</a> offices and saying hello to all my ex-workmates. Nice, really nice; I miss them. :'-)

	Happy whatever! (Don't worry if don't get it, just kidding :-D)
