<h3>A fresh Monkey in my Window</h3>
<p>
	It's been two months since <a href="http://monkey.workarea.jp/">Atsushi</a> sent a <a href="http://shana.iidbbs.com/en/mono_cygwin_tutorial.html">guide</a> for building mcs and mono modules on Windows, using Cygwin. It took me the whole morning to set everything as explained but finally yesterday it perfectly compiled. It spent one hour and a half approximately, just counting <code>make</code> command.
</p>
<p>
	As backup, I'd like to let written down an issue have encountered during setting paths properly. When executing <code>make install</code>, as guide advises, some Unix-like end-of-lines breaks the execution. No problem, some "\r\n" replacing for "\n" and done.
</p>
<p>
	Imagine my face when I've seen this:
	<pre>
$ which mono
/usr/local/bin/mono

$ mono -V

	Fresh, fresh. :'-)
