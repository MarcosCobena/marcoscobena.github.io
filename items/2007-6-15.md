	I started this week with NUnit tests for CustomPeerResolverService. In
a first step, I ran all of them against Microsoft implementation. Once
I had a little but nice test suite, changing Microsoft
System.ServiceModel.dll for Mono one let me find quickly some
implementation differences. I ran through some issues when trying CLR
to load Mono assembly, so I'm tracking this, and future ones, at:

	As part of System.ServiceModel.PeerResolvers namespace, I've started
hacking: RefreshInfo.cs, RefreshResponseInfo.cs, RefreshResult.cs,
RegisterInfo.cs, RegisterResponseInfo.cs, ResolveInfo.cs,
ResolveResponseInfo.cs, ServiceSettingsResponseInfo.cs,
UnregisterInfo.cs and UpdateInfo.cs.

	Looking for some more in depth information on
CustomPeerResolverService, I've found some interesting links:

	After playing a little bit more with chat application, I think it'd be
fine to have first of all server side working with Mono assembly and
client side with Microsoft one, and this will be my next closer goal.
Please, let me know if it'd be worth to go for a different approach
instead.

<p>
	I'm having two of my last three exams next week, so I won't be able to
dedicate so much time to hack until Friday morning. Once I finish all
of them, I'll commit the entire change set I'm doing locally.
