<h3>Done</h3>
<p>
	Yesterday afternoon I gave my fifteen minutes talk on my work with Mono Olive during summer. It was only fifteen because it's the time every student has to defend a Final Project.
</p>
<p>
	I was a bit nervous. Some folks from .NET Club came to watch it, also my father was between them. My main goal yesterday was to express I love what I do and, honestly, I think I made my bit to achieve it, so I'm happy independently on the marks.
</p>
<p>
	Thanks for those who came, also equally for those who couldn't but send me a bunch of e-mails, phone calls, SMSs, etc. Huge thanks.
</p>
<p>
	Now that it's done, I'll keep spending my spare time on my lovely WCF (also, yesterday I received the book I was waiting for three (3) months from Amazon, superb service).
</p>
<p>
	My friend Jose gave me a book as a present on Maths and paradoxes, and one of the examples it brings with sums up my feelings on all I've read about some people expressing their opposition to Microsoft-Novell collaboration for Moonlight: <cite>This sentence is false</cite>. Miguel and the rest of the team: keep up the superb work, I love what you do. ;-)
