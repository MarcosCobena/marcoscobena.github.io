<h3>Un Vista-zo</h3>
<p>
	Not my laptop, but my parents' one was upgraded yesterday to Windows Vista. I used to play with betas but never had experienced before installing final one. Impresive, it took 30 mins. approximately since it began to install until I could start using desktop. No additional drivers, no device problems, no incompatibilties, everything worked out-of-the-box.
