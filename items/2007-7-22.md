<h3>System.ServiceModel, NetPeerTcpBinding Class and System.ServiceModel.PeerResolvers. Weekly Status Report #{7, 8}</h3>

	I apologize for delaying my status report. Past week, as you already
know, we had the midterm evaluation. As my student dashboard keeps
saying "Application accepted!", this means Atsushi, my mentor, trusted
on me to finish my work during summer. Really thanks!

	TCP stuff from my previous report
(<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youcannoteatbits.org/Blog/Archives/2007-July.html#Sunday%2c+July+08%2c+2007">http://www.youcannoteatbits.org/Blog/Archives/2007-July.html#Sunday%2...</a>)
works now (I haven't done stress tests however, and it'd need some
more love in a close future). It means, it's currently possible to
send/receive text encoded messages over TCP. Even more, it currently
works if you mix up client/service with .NET version! You can try it
out your-self: <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/olive/samples/services/tcp-transport-binding-element/">http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/olive/samples/services/t...</a>.
Thanks to Atsushi who everyday helped me to find out how .NET protocol
exchanges messages, I've learned a huge with this. Thanks mate!

	Right now, this past week, I've been working back to
NetPeerTcpBinding, which will be my primary job until the end, so I've
tried to divide this task into little ones:
	<ol>
		<li>Callback contracts. David Pallmann's book
(<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-INDIGO-David-Pallmann/dp/0735621519/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-7489901-8089518?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1185115496&amp;sr=8-1">http://www.amazon.com/Programming-INDIGO-David-Pallmann/dp/0735621519...</a>)
treats this topic pretty well. I should have this working standalone,
having a sample callback contract application.</li>
		<li>NetPeerTcpBinding. It relies on:</li>
		<ol>
			<li>BinaryMessageEncodingBindingElement. As Olive status exposes
(<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/olive/status/status.txt">http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/olive/status/status.txt</a>),
it needs S.R.Serialization.dll which's not finished.</li>
			<li>PeerCustomResolverBindingElement.</li>
			<li>PeerTransportBindingElement.</li>
		</ol>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>
	Apart from these points, there are some more stuff needed concerning
new final WCF API, etc. I've also updated simple chat application
using this thing, which can be found at:
<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/olive/samples/services/net-peer-tcp-binding-chat/">http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/olive/samples/services/n...</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Due to the dependency (among little API mismatch and unimplemented
parts), I'd like to know if possible which's the best direction to go
through this. I mean, the best roadmap for getting chat sample working
without spending time hacking other parts which could be missed right
now.
</p>
<p>
	I'd like to discuss this having in mind it can be possible once the
summer ends chat isn't working (I'll try not to), but there can be
other parts done. I'd thank it twice, as I wouldn't ping my mentor so
many times during the week, although I've promised him I'll send some
Spanish food once I get the Mono t-shirt (which could be done at
Madrid if Mono Summit hosts there). ;-)
