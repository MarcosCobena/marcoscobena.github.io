	Last weekend, my parents introduced me a great music group: <a href="http://www.cadencia.org/">Cadencia</a>. They were performing at Seville, so they had the opportunity to show their unique style. As I couldn't attend it, <a href="http://www.joseantoniocobena.com/?p=236">my father noticed me</a> they have available some songs from their last album: <a href="http://www.cadencia.org/mp3.htm">Sin ti</a>, which sounds really really really nice. I encourage everyone to try it out.
