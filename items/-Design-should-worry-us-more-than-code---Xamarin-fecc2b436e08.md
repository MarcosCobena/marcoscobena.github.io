Thanks Dachi for the chance, since I’ve wanted this opportunity for long time now, and the day arrived :-)

The talk won’t be on how to design mobile apps, it isn’t targeted for pure Designers. It’ll drive us through how Developers can move closer to Designers in order to leverage what for me have direct impact in our final users: what they actually see.

What you see vs. what they’re playing ([Radcliffe Orchestra rehearsing](https://www.flickr.com/photos/11152520@N03/5504054428/in/photolist-9onHC9-5u5We-52uvA-3kCBco-9iRBQc-e4RfKs-PHrAk-a7KUBL-a7KXJW-a7H3Vi-brh9wV-g79Efk-52g32C-eB5X9f-9niaRu-5m47EH-4rJq5A-6oxw15-qRqitz-qz1fm3-qjUiY3-NuZaH-c2E1VU-c2DSQu-A9X5S-c2E4p3-9nf8nr-9niaSQ-6eEUF7-qRqjbB-8cRhFs-9niaFA-9nf8rp-82LH8n-9niaWb-9niaQ1-aArBNz-eJhBGW-c2E4CG-c2E1mS-9jxxY-eaAGae-oFcebk-c2E4X9-c2DSgo-4EwMDP-fKzEMh-c2DVU5-7XcSZ-9jxNW))Why linked to Xamarin? Mainly because it’s my main toolset nowadays, and Xamarin.Forms specifically is reaching a point where complex UIs can be achieved, so I feel we need to go one step further.

Also, studying Graphic Design has put me on a position where can better understand Designers, and why their decisions impact what we do, but almost no one talks about _how_ we do it.

On last week on-site visit, I spent 3 days at Inditex, mainly teaching how to find both performance and memory leak issues with Xamarin Profiler. As it always happens, have learnt a lot too, and come quite happy with the level people are achieving with Xamarin.
