I don't know exactly how to begin this entry. While going back by train from Mono Summit at Madrid, I began to ask my-self why I'm not just working full-time on that I love (again, <a href="/Blog/Archives/2006-April.html#Wednesday%2c+April+26%2c+2006">I already took this decision two years ago</a>) instead of attending classes.<br /><br />Spending some hours with some part of the Mono team was a big lesson: how they organize, their vision on Mono's future, their out-of-the-box ideas, their humility. That last thing is pretty important, absolutely.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_z2FqY6j3nZs/R1F1PTP3lgI/AAAAAAAAA3I/uWtcnTiFub4/s1600-R/Rupert.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp3.blogger.com/_z2FqY6j3nZs/R1F1PTP3lgI/AAAAAAAAA3I/U767eUdS5mg/s400/Rupert.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5139017555531765250" border="0" /></a><span style="font-style: italic;">Eno's gift in return from my olives</span></div><br />Yesterday I was getting my friend <a href="http://projects.ilikecoffee.net/sharpknocking/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Migue</span></a> (we used to work together on a .NET project; he currently keeps on it, and also loves Mono as well) to his bus stop, and I was telling him the thing I most liked from my flash visit was, minutes before leaving, <a href="http://veritas-vos-liberabit.com/lb/">Eno</a> and <a href="http://tirania.org/">Miguel</a> embraced me as one does with his closest friends... Thanks guys.<br /><br />PS: I think calculus exam went fine.
