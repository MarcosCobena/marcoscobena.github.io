<em>¡Buenos días!</em> is the spanish translation for Good morning! What does this have in common with mobile apps or Xamarin?

<a href="http://www.aroideas.com/">Álvaro Reinoso</a> (Aro) is a freelance artist who takes a picture of the reality around him every day (from monday to friday), and draws up to transform it into something very valuable. He shares it on Twitter every morning, accompanied by the hashtag #buenosdias, translated into multiple languages. I met Aro when I was going to work at <a href="http://workincompany.com/">workINcompany</a> (a coworking space in Seville), and since then I have always had the idea of making an app that takes his work to each mobile device.

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Why saying good morning is a good idea? (Only available in spanish, sorry; but drawings are self-explanatory)</em></p>

I had some meetings with Aro, sketching what we both would like the app to do. Everything said, it was much more further what the app does actually. However, as I learned do not remember where about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVPs</a> (not Microsoft/Xamarin ones hehe, but Minimum Viable Products), it is important to focus on <em>that</em> functionality which holds the reason why the app should exist. I liked reading on <a href="http://motzcod.es/post/112797487377/coffee-filter-a-c-powered-android-app-in-2-days">Coffee Filter</a>, from James Montemagno and Frank Krueger, because I feel in the roots the same concerning bringing ideas to apps.

The app ¡Buenos días! just does that: shows the last image, created that same morning. I have tried to display it with the same affection with which Aro creates it, and also make it super simple to share. I really enjoyed working on it. I guess it comes from the times when I was a child, and was everyday with LEGO blocks, dreaming with inventing new stuff.

<a href="http://xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a> is for me with 30 years old what LEGO was with 10. I have made it using my beloved <a href="http://xamarin.com/forms">Xamarin.Forms</a>, with a little bit of XAML, querying <a href="https://twitter.com/reinoso_alvaro">Aro's Twitter account</a> through <a href="https://linqtotwitter.codeplex.com/">LINQ to Twitter</a>. Some <a href="https://github.com/MarcosCobena/BuenosDias#buenos-días">plugins</a> have made my life easier too. Initially, the idea was to share the source code on my GitHub account, and write a post here, but I did not feel comfortable with that: this app should be available to anyone, with ease:

Finally, I would like to thank my parents, neighborhood friends and workmates at <a href="http://www.plainconcepts.com/">Plain Concepts</a>, which have played around with it those days, specially: Javier Fernández, thank you guy for sharing that crash trace; David Ávila, he made me think about the animations which happen on the app, thank you dude. Both sent me even some features which would be cool to have. <a href="https://github.com/MarcosCobena/BuenosDias/issues">Written down</a>.
