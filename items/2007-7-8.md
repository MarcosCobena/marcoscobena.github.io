	This week has been all about TCP channels.
</p>
<p>
	In order to get peer stuff running, I'm currently working on TCP one from zero, as there's nothing done on that side. Instead of going directly to NetPeerTcpBinding I've started with TcpTransportBindingElement, as every TCP connections relies on that binding element.

</p>
<p>
	As immediate goal, I've selected an example (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/olive/samples/services/tcp-transport-binding-element/">http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/trunk/olive/samples/services/t...</a>) using a custom binding for testing how to send and receive messages through TCP. Inside of it, one of the things which needs is a channel factory (listener) on client (server) side:

	<code>
		<pre>
	IChannelFactory&lt;IDuplexSessionChannel&gt; factory = binding.BuildChannelFactory&lt;IDuplexSessionChannel&gt;(bpcol);
		</pre>
	</code>
</p>
<p>
	, and here's where I've spent most of the time, studying different channel shapes and trying to fit my approach with existing code. This last thing comes up because of the existence of those channel factories as internal classes, and the lack of documentation in depth about them. Finally, for now, I'm going for this approach:

	Thanks to my dear lazy Web, I found WCF Channels Mini Book (Clemens Vasters, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://wcf.netfx3.com/files/folders/product_team/entry3550.aspx">http://wcf.netfx3.com/files/folders/product_team/entry3550.aspx</a>), which explains quite fine everything about channels (including session-full ones), and how to code your owns (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms729840.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms729840.aspx</a>).

	There's one thing which has kept me confused the entire week. During one of these last mornings, Atsushi and I discussed on the use of DuplexChannelFactory. It looks somewhat logical to use this factory as I'm working with duplex channels, but playing with .NET version seems to behave in a different way. I mean, when calling <code>BuildChannelFactory&lt;IDuplexSessionChannel&gt;()</code>, .NET returns a TcpChannelFactory object, not DuplexChannelFactory one. So, this' the reason why I'm not currently using DuplexChannelFactory on the diagram. Also, almost every example I've found on this makes use of that factory in a different scenario as the one I'm working with (for example, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1190604&amp;SiteID=1">http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1190604&amp;SiteID=1</a>).
</p>
<p>
	Anyway, as always, I really appreciate any kind of help to clear my mind on this. I've had these days some dreams about duplex channels. :-)
