	I'm back from holidays.
</p>
<p>
	This week I've kept working on CustomPeerResolverService. I've rebuilt
mcs/mono from SVN and Windows crashes don't appear anymore. Yeah!
</p>
<p>
	I'm trying to enable support for IsWrapped MessageContract's property,
and once having it Mono version should communicate with no problem
with .NET one. Having the rest of PeerResolvers *Info will be then
pretty straightforward. I hope to have CustomPeerResolverService fully
working during incoming week, which will suppose to have achieved one
of my SoC goals! :'-)
</p>
<p>
	My main resource is focused on Microsoft Windows SDK WCF samples, as
it provides a custom linear peer resolver implementation.
