OK, so the thing is I was planning my visit to Mono Summit, but two amazing exams have populated my calendar that same week, on Monday and Friday.<br /><br />One option is to miss one of them, which's no good for my health, honestly. On the other side, I could leave Seville on Tuesday morning, spend the whole day with Mono developers, and be back that same night. Right now, there are tickets available.<br /><br />So, folks, would you let me attend Tuesday 27th talks?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update:</span> Confirmed by Miguel, I've just bought my train tickets, I'll be there on Tuesday 27th. I feel right now like waiting for an incoming rock stars performance! :-)
