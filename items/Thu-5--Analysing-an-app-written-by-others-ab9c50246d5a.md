### Thu 5: Analysing an app written by others

From Wednesday to Friday I’ll be working on an analysis of a Xamarin.Forms app to detect those places where performance can be gained and which actions can be performed to mitigate such. It’s a production app which serve as the entry point to an entire business, thus awesome to have the chance to work on this.

Although I won’t be actually writing within these days am learning different ways of doing things, and really cool ones.
