<h3>MIX07</h3>

	<img alt="LET'S MIX" src="http://visitmix.com/downloads/bling/red_lets.gif" style="border: 0px none ; padding: 10px;" align="right">

	I've woken up this morning reading <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2007/May-01.html">Miguel's entry on MIX07</a>. It's highly exciting to see all those incomings technologies for .NET world.
</p>
<p>
	During keynotes, there have been lot of announcements, but for me more importants are:
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Silverlight.</strong> Microsoft's published two new versions: Microsoft Silverlight 1.0 Beta Software Development Kit (SDK) and Microsoft Silverlight 1.1 Alpha Software Development Kit (SDK). Both runtimes and SDKs can be downloaded <a href="http://silverlight.net/GetStarted/">here</a>, among other bits.</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Dyanmic Language Runtime (DLR).</strong> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/hugunin/default.aspx">Jim Hugunin</a> explains it perfectly fine:
			<blockquote xml:lang="en" cite="http://blogs.msdn.com/hugunin/archive/2007/04/30/a-dynamic-language-runtime-dlr.aspx">
				The new Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) adds a small set of key features to the CLR to make it dramatically better.  It adds to the platform a set of services designed explicitly for the needs of dynamic languages.  These include a shared dynamic type system, standard hosting model and support to make it easy to generate fast dynamic code.  With these additional features it becomes dramatically easier to build high-quality dynamic language implementations on .NET.  More importantly, these features enable all of the dynamic languages which use the DLR to freely share code with other dynamic languages as well as with the existing powerful static languages on the platform such as VB.NET and C#.

<h3>Silverlight and Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR), highly coupled</h3>
<p>
	In the meantime you read next lines, go and launch this <a href="http://silverlight.net/learn/learnvideo.aspx?video=74">video</a>. As you can appreciate, it's now possible within Silverlight 1.1 to use dynamic code like this:
	<code>
		<pre>
// JavaScript (EcmaScript 3.0) piece
var add = function(x, y) {
	return x + y;
}

add(1, 2)
3.0

// VB.NET piece
Function Calculate(fn, x, y) {
	Return fn(x, y);
End Function

// Back to JavaScript (EcmaScript 3.0)
Calculate(add, 3, 4)
7.0

// Ruby piece
canvas.background = wpf.green_brush // Changing it dinamically
		</pre>
	</code>
	For all of you with some sort of experience on Lisp, i. e. it's somewhat likely lambda expressions, but with the power of multi-language support, and so on current CLR can support.
</p>
<p>
	Altough DLR is still immature, it currently supports four languages: JavaScript (EcmaScript 3.0), Python, Ruby and Visual Basic .NET. It ships with Silverlight 1.1 runtime, but its source's been release under <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/licensingbasics/permissivelicense.mspx">Microsoft Permissive License</a>, so you can have a wide look to its inside <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/SourceControl/DirectoryView.aspx?SourcePath=%24%2fIronPython%2fIronPython_Main%2fSrc%2fMicrosoft.Scripting&changeSetId=21805">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	By the way, I'm waiting my friend <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/davidsalgado/default.aspx">David</a> to be back from U.S. and write a full post, with photos, on everything he saw at this 72-hour conversation. Let's write guy. ;-)

<h3>My thoughts on M[IX07|ono]</h3>
<p>
	<em>(Before you read the rest, I'm new to Mono developer community so maybe my opinion's far from where it should be. Sorry in advance if it's)</em>
</p>
<p>
	Mono *must* go for something like Silverlight, sharing basics but whitout being the same, as Miguel exposes. Market's mostly driven by communicated applications day to day, and that's what most developers look for when thinking on something new.
</p>
<p>
	Mono's the luck of sharing DNA with Microsoft .NET, in the same percentage as Microsoft .NET with Mono, as both let the brother to share some specific patterns. If we think on future, based on today, it's difficult to think on desktop applications beyond something like a browser or similar, exposing a clear interface to the Web. This' the point where I think Mono should turn to: the interface to the Web. You can think it's true Microsoft's currently marks the time on what direction does .NET take or not, but I think it isn't that way. Redmond hackers just adapt their technology to what market asks for, and Mono has, and is doing, a great job here.
</p>
<p>
	Right now, I couldn't say at assembly level which things I consider more interesting to implement, but for sure everything related to communications, and Silverlight, i. e., plays an important role there.
</p>
<p>
	In the meantime, I'll continue contributing Mono with my few bits of WCF. I've to say it's thrilling to take part in a project like this one's. :-)
