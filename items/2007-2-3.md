<h3>Almost ready for Vista</h3>
<p>
	My laptop's just passed <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=42B5AC83-C24F-4863-A389-3FFC194924F8&displaylang=en">Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor 1.0</a> test. It's true I need to free some space before in my main drive (only if want to update, not in a clean one) but that's not a problem.
</p>
<p>
	It's been some days from launch and have read some opinions from people. As I like to tell the truth, let's try to discuss about some of them.
</p>
<h4>It's very beautiful but, is it really important?</h4>
<p>
	It isn't. Even more, it's possible to do almost everything without GUI, just in command line. But it's important to let us *choose*. If we don't like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/features/details/aero.mspx">Aero</a>, just turn it off and done. GUI, Aero here, just tries to improve our experience when using it, nothing more, and it seems logical to have those improvements as the market goes in this direction. I really like <a href="http://www.apple.com/es/macosx/leopard/coreanimation.html">Mac OS X</a> and <a href="http://www.novell.com/products/desktop/features/xgl/">Xgl running on Compiz</a> user experiences, and find interesting to have something similar in Vista. Why not?
</p>
<h4>Installing it'll make your computer to go slowly and run out-of-memory</h4>
<p>
	Well, it's actually true Vista needs more memory available than XP to run applications, but going beyond can help us to understand why this happens a little bit more. As you can appreciate at Tom's Hardware <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/01/29/xp-vs-vista/">article</a> related to this subject, most applications under XP go currently faster (see from <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/01/29/xp-vs-vista/page4.html">here</a> to <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/01/29/xp-vs-vista/page10.html">here</a>) and that's something I particulary expected. At the end of the article it's summarized a brief overview:
</p>
<p>
	<blockquote>
		<i>
Our hopes that Vista might be able to speed up applications are gone. First tests with 64-bit editions result in numbers similar to our 32-bit results, and we believe it's safe to say that users looking for more raw performance will be disappointed with Vista. <b>Vista is the better Windows, because it behaves better, because it looks better and because it feels better. But it cannot perform better than Windows XP. Is this a K.O. for Windows Vista in the enthusiast space?</b>
		</i>
	</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
	Honestly, I think it doesn't. An OS isn't just speed, but keep on reading:
</p>
<p>
	<blockquote>
		<i>
If you really need your PC to finish huge encoding, transcoding or rendering workloads within a defined time frame, yes, it is. Don't do it; stay with XP. But as long as you don't need to finish workloads in record time, we believe it makes sense to consider these three bullet points:

<ul>
    <li>Vista runs considerably more services and thus has to spend somewhat more resources on itself. Indexing, connectivity and usability don't come for free.</li>
    <li>There is a lot of CPU performance available today! We've got really fast dual core processors, and even faster quad cores will hit the market by the middle of the year. Even though you will lose application performance by upgrading to Vista, today's hardware is much faster than yesterday's, and tomorrow's processors will clearly leap even further ahead.</li>
    <li>No new Windows release has been able to offer more application performance than its predecessor.</li>
</ul>

<b>Although application performance has had this drawback, the new Windows Vista performance features SuperFetch and ReadyDrive help to make Vista feel faster and smoother than Windows XP.</b> Our next article will tell you how they work.
		</i>
	</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
	As article mentions (don't know why in the last lines...), Vista comes up with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/features/details/superfetch.mspx">SuperFetch</a>, which basically manages RAM memory and preload applications into it for a better experience:
</p>
<p>
	<blockquote>
		<i>
A new memory management technology in Windows Vista, Windows SuperFetch, helps keep the computer consistently responsive to your programs by making better use of the computer's RAM. Windows SuperFetch prioritizes the programs you're currently using over background tasks and adapts to the way you work by tracking the programs you use most often and preloading these into memory. With SuperFetch, background tasks still run when the computer is idle. However, when the background task is finished, SuperFetch repopulates system memory with the data you were working with before the background task ran. Now, when you return to your desk, your programs will continue to run as efficiently as they did before you left.
		</i>
	</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
	Ok, so this' one of the reasons why Vista consumes more memory. I'm quite sure everyone who asked him-self if Vista will run or not slower and/or out-of-memory first used his favourite searching engine and take a look to this information, but just in case.
</p>
<h4>Vista's unsafe</h4>
<p>
	Chema controls about those topics better than me, so I really encourage you to go through his <a href="http://elladodelmal.blogspot.com/2007/02/no-compres-vista-por-la-seguridad.html">post</a> (Spanish, sorry). In addition, you can have a wide read on User Account Control (UAC) and other security topics <a href="http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2007/01/23/security-features-vs-convenience.aspx">here</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/windowsvistasecurity/">here</a>, etc.
</p>
<p>
	As conclusion, I'll update my laptop and give it a try as soon as finish my last exams, in two weeks. I'll write down my first impressions.
