Subtitle sums up pretty well what the story is about: <span style="font-style: italic;">How A Tiny Number of Genes Creates the Complexities of Human Thought</span>.<br /><br />Even being a book talking about genes, it's highly interesting for anyone working on software. <a href="http://www.psych.nyu.edu/gary/">Gary Marcus</a>' (the author) family (I don't remember fine now whether it was his father) comes from software development field, and he, Gary, tries to express genes as computer instructions full of <span style="font-family:courier new;">IF</span> and <span style="font-family:courier new;">THEN</span>. Brilliant.<br /><br />It's been the second time I've read an amazing book recommended by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sacha">Sacha</a> so, guy, which's the following one?
