<h3>To Zion</h3>
<p>
	This was the name of my part in the conference given yesterday afternoon toguether with three more exciting people: Jorge Cant&oacute;n, Jorge Moreno and my, lovely, father.
</p>
<p>
	While talking, and listening to my mates, felt like enjoying the best conference I've ever taken part on. It's, surely, the very first time we've enjoyed from the very beginning, until the end. We gave out some pins for each attendee, with our <a href="http://www.cs.us.es/DiNeT/">Web site</a> printed on. It was *very* nice to check almost (maybe 100%) people was paying absolutely attention to each one of us, and that's something I'd really like to thank.
</p>
<p>
	Also thanks to every people immersed in <a href="http://imaginatica.eii.us.es/2007/">Imagin&aacute;tica</a>, organization in charge of those fantastic technology conferences, who trusted on and let us sharing our, for now thin, knowledge on the brain, intelligence, computational neuroscience and so on. Again, really thanks.
</p>
<p>
	Even better, if possible, was the release of <a href="http://www.numenta.com/for-developers/software.php">NuPIC</a>, the Numenta Platform for Intelligent Computing, coinciding with our participation on this topic, HTM.
</p>
<p>
	Now, it's time to keep on working. Welcome to the very close future of AI. :-)
